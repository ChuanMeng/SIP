CQ_FD	the problem is n't that the application installation is corrupted it is that there is a bug in the program it affects all the systems that i have \( 1 pc , 1 phone and 1 tablet \) and the problem also is if i use it without the application at all but login to a webpage to use the diet tracker i e msn health fitness it 's a programming bug you can use the 'recent' list and the 'custom' list no problem however the 'favorites' list screws up the entries even on the website with no app installed also there are favourites that are left over from when it used the 'health vault' that cannot be deleted or used so that causes problems as well for example if i login to the msn health and fitness and then select , 'chicken fillet classic subway' from my favourites menu , then nothing happens i cannot use the item and i cannot delete it either another example if i use the windows 8 1 app it does let me select the 'chicken fillet classic subway' however when it populates the data in to the 'lunch' field the carbs , protein and fat data is all zero and the calories information is wrong once this happens reselecting the item from 'recent' then reproduces the error so for the moment the 'favourites' menu is bugged my wife has the same problem which is a pity because the app has tons of potential __eou__	User

PA	marian , do the following system restore takes about ten minutes to run during which the computer will reboot , you may be faced at some point with a black screen where nothing appears to be happening , but eventually , the usual lock screen will appear once more check to make sure both folders are back again to remove files which are safe to delete , do the following do n't listen to dummies on forums who tell you it 's ok to delete certain files and folders because half the time , they do n't have a clue of what they 're talking about you can always come to this forum for advice if you need it __eou__	Agent
FD	thank you for the reply and sadly the only restore points were from a few days ago , also the files are not gone they were restored but missing lot 's of things __eou__	User
FD_PA	mariany , when you run system restore , it winds back the clock to the date you choose so only the files which were there on that date are restored , anything you installed after that date wo n't appear anymore and will have to be reinstalled if the temp and startup folders have n't come back , you can undo the restoration by running the same menu again you 'll see the option to undo when you click the system restore button that way , you 'll get your missing files back again you could try looking in the recycle bin to see if they 're in there if they are , right click them and choose restore windows will replace them in the same location they were removed from __eou__	Agent
FD	again this happened a few months ago , my recycle bin is empty and there is no date before the delete __eou__	User
FD_PA	some files can be deleted from the temp folder , but not the folder itself because windows uses it to hold temporary files in it 's a bit like your car and it 's gas tank you can drain it , but you still have a fully functional automobile but if you remove the gas tank , then you 're not going to be going anywhere until you replace it you now find yourself in that situation with your computer until you replace the temp folder and its contents , your machine is not going to function properly i think you 're looking at having to refresh the system in order to get it going again what you 'll have to do first is to create a recovery disk and copy the manufacturer 's partition to that this means you 'll have to go buy an external hard drive with at least 60gb free but bearing in mind that the cost of a 60gb hard disk and one with a 500gb capacity is barely a matter of cents , you 'll be better off with the large capacity drive which you can use for other purposes later to create the recovery drive , hit windows key to open the start screen with the tiles and start typing the word recovery you 'll see the option called create a recovery drive appear on the right click that and then click next here 's a screenshot then follow instructions in this article http windows microsoft com en gb windows 8 restore refresh reset pc __eou__	Agent

FD_FQ_NF	hello , i checked and have taken a screenshot for you it 's still not working it should say 2 instead of 64 it 's the exact same equation i used for the other months except the last number changed per month __eou__	User

PA	since you are now doing a mathematical operation with \( month \( c 4 j 13 \) 1 \) \( c 4 j 13 \) , the initial 1 is superfluous this works sumproduct \( \( month \( c 4 j 13 \) 1 \) \( c 4 j 13 \) \) best wishes __eou__	Agent

OQ	is there a way to contact skype support via email to reset a password \? i tried unsuccessfully to reset the password to my skype account by answering the security questions one too many times i originally had two email addresses associated with the account unfortunately email1 is from a previous work email \( no longer valid \) and email2 is tied to an account that has the mailbox full and cannot receive messages i ended up creating a second skype account tied to a third email address , email3 would it be possible for skype support to send the reset code to email3 \? i can actually send emails using email2 \( and can include the code you send to email3 \) i just ca n't receive emails to the email2 account and cleaning up the email2 mailbox will take too much time __eou__	User
FD_PA	hi stephanieskypeuser and welcome to the skype community ! password reset codes are sent by the system for verification that the user requesting access to the account is the true account owner skype support cannot send the reset code for your password manually , as this will be sent by the system automatically to the registered security information of your account \( which in your case are the two email addresses \) if the owner requests a password reset since you have access to the second email address of the account , you can try deleting a few spam or junk emails which you no longer deem important , the reset code will be sent once so you do not have to worry that you 'll be spammed after you successfully reset your password and signed in to your account , i advice that you update your security info and include your third email address to the list of your security info so you can use this email to reset your password please refer to this link for additional details let us know if you need further clarification assistance thank you __eou__	Agent

OQ	hi i'm trying to import a text file into excel but having problems with delimiters here 's a simplified example of the file i'm trying to import look simple but the problem is that the file sometimes uses tab as a delimiter and sometimes used spaces , so i import and get results like i 've tried using the custom delimiter but ca n't get it to work and the online documentation is pretty useless any advice thanks ! __eou__	User
PA	hello , in a delimited file , there should only ever be one type of delimiter a mix of different delimiters , i e tab or single space will always cause issues i suggest you open the file with the delimiter set to a character that you know does not exist in the dataset , for example a pipe symbol then all data opens in one column next , do a replace values and replace all space characters with tabs after that , use the split column command to split using the tab character here is the complete m code let source csv document \( file contents \( c datacarsales txt \) , delimiter , columns 1 , encoding 1252 , quotestyle quotestyle none \) , replaced value table replacevalue \( source , , \( tab \) , replacer replacetext , column1 \) , split column by delimiter table splitcolumn \( replaced value , column1 , splitter splittextbydelimiter \( \( tab \) , quotestyle csv \) , column1 1 , column1 2 , column1 3 \) , changed type table transformcolumntypes \( split column by delimiter , column1 1 , type text , column1 2 , int64 type , column1 3 , type number \) in changed type __eou__	Agent
PF	teylyn , thanks very much for this i'm surprised how limited the custom delimiter functionality is in power query i'm new to power query , but is seems an excellent tool , and the sort of problem i posted is not uncommon when you 're dealing with files from multiple sources who create these files manually \( e g insurance company receiving many data files from small brokers underwriters \) your workaround , however , does the trick it 's very similar to the way i used to deal with this sort of issues , i e with an excel macro __eou__	User
FD_PA	hello again , thanks for the feedback the custom delimiter option gives you the tool to determine what character is used as the delimiter in your data set it does not cover the possibilities of mixed delimiters in a data source mixing delimiters is not good practice and should be discouraged the custom delimiter in power query is actually quite powerful , because you can define a delimiter that contains more than one character , thus saving additional steps to clean up the resulting data so , the delimiter could be a string like \( i e space , space , dash , space , space \) and power query will happily slice the data when it finds that string , whereas importing a file with the old tools only allowed for one character to be the delimiter but the delimiter must always be the same throughout the data set that 's the whole idea of a delimiter files from multiple sources can easily be handled with power query each file may need different handling for delimiters etc take each file at a time and determine its delimiter then combine the results of different queries as required __eou__	Agent

OQ	my brother gave me his fairly new laptop recently and i need to use microsoft word when i go to open word \( 2016 \) at the very top reads sunscription expired most of the features of word have been disabled and gives me the option to reactivate i click reactivate and there are three option i can choose from buy , enter key or sign in i click enter key and for some reason the zero 's in my product key do not come up on screen therefore it will not let me enter the product key info i can enter all the other number expect the zero 's if i go to sign in it says the product is not associated with my account the other problem i'm having is if i go to help it says a world wide web browser such as window internet explorer is required to use this feature and i have internet explorer up and running my question is can i reactivate word just by using the product key , and if so why ca n't i enter all the number in the product key \? __eou__	User
PA	hi , product keys do not contain 0s or os those used are 2346789bcdfghjkmpqrtvwxy those unused are 015aeilnosuz and if you decide to try to use the windows product key , it is not the product key to use for office office has to be bought and paid for separately cheers __eou__	Agent
PA	the message referring to a subscription would indicate this is an office 365 installation which requires renewal on a monthly or yearly basis as michael says this product key is not the windows activation key but is the same format \( 5 x 5 alphanumeric characters \) and has no zero or o character in it if it is an office 365 subscription then it is almost certainly based on his microsoft account login and without those credentials you would not be able to renew it hence the not associated message , he has the subscription not you you would have to buy your own subscription and reinstall office from your login generally speaking the advice when getting a second hand computer is to reset windows completely and remove anything installed after it factory load __eou__	Agent

OQ	hi , i have a surface rt which has served me well for almost 2 years now but i 've seem to run into a problem i used to have an app which was sketchbook express \( and autodesk sketchbook \) in my tablet but a few days ago , i 've suddenly uninstalled it along with a couple other apps i tried going to the windows store to install them once more but it keeps giving me the error code ox80240017 under the apps not installed on this pc were the list of all the apps i was trying to install and it all says under them not available i tried installing other apps but they were completely fine the only ones not installing were the apps i used to have and accidentally uninstalled i 've done many steps to solve error code \( refresh , resetting the store , troubleshooting \) , but none of them seems to work is there any way for me to get back my uninstalled apps \? __eou__	User

OQ	i am very upset with how skype has made it impossible to easily deal with support issues when the new skype was introduced i was unable to access my account because my mac has os 10 6 8 i had a subscription which i had paid for three months of north american calls to landlines and there 's no way that i could get on to skype to cancel this subscription i'm definitely not buying another mac just so i can upgrade because my computer is running fine i did however borrow a computer so that i could sign into skype and see what was going on i set up the new skype and accessed my account and it says i have no subscriptions so i do n't know what is going on when the new skype was introduced were all old subscriptions automatically cancelled and will i get a refund for the unused portion \? \? \? __eou__	User

FQ_IR	what values are showing in all of those cells \? __eou__	Agent
FD	e11 shows 51 , 452 b13 shows 3 , 000 b14 shows 15 b11 shows 75 d11 shows 1 e10 shows 67 , 700 b10 shows 75 d10 shows 0 e9 shows 90 , 267 __eou__	User
PA	i think it 's due to how you have the numbers formatted in those cells there are no decimals in your numbers in the above post , but the result of the formula in cell e10 should be 67 , 700 25 instead of 67 , 700 \( 90 , 267 75 67 , 700 25 \) that is assuming the starting number in e9 is 90 , 267 without decimals so even though you do n't see the decimals in the cell , the formula includes the decimals if you format your cells to show two decimal places , and enter those numbers in the calculator , they will match __eou__	Agent

OQ	a few months ago , microsoft showed off a new exciting feature for powerpoint that allows users to insert 3d models directly from paint 3d from there , they showed amazing transitions and movement on the 3d models using the morph transition it was supposed to be released alongside the creators update , but seems to be delayed as it is not here \( although there is a support article for it , even though it is not out yet \) i cannot find anything on when this feature will become available , so any estimates , speculations , or knowledge on when it will be released is greatly appreciated thanks for your help \( bellow is a picture of the feature from microsoft 's keynote presentation \) __eou__	User

PA	i'm not sure what jack 's answer really means , so i 'll try it myself in order to get the new paint3d app that allows you to create edit models , you need to have windows 10 creators edition to insert 3d models from a file into powerpoint , you do n't need win10 , but at least for now , you need to be running an insider version of powerpoint 365 i 've got the 3d option here on a win7 system to be on insider , you need to be running a subscription version of powerpoint office go to file account and under the office logo , it should say subscription product if so , you can sign up for office insider version if you wish bear in mind that insider users are essentially testers you get the newest stuff first the new patches , the new features and the new bugs if you depend on ppt for your living , insider may not be the best idea __eou__	Agent

CQ_IR_PA	hi , i just want to clarify things here , are you using a computer along with its camera to make a video call but using your phone 's wi fi data \? \( based from what you 've mentioned i checked that my computer speed was fast enough \) if so , when you do a phone call , that will interfere the connection that skype is getting from your device and the call will be interrupted in that case , you have to stop the video call and start over again for the camera to work if my understanding above is incorrect and if you 're using your phone and its camera to make a video call same thing will happen the bottom line is , you 're using the data of your phone which i believe is coming from its network \( signal \) wi fi data is connected through it thus network disruption will occur jose skype community moderator __eou__	Agent

OQ	hello everyone , i have a very simplistic question that may have rather complex answers what is going on with bing and facebook \? why is microsoft no longer allowing facebook users to collect rewards and such \? is there something we do n't get or is this microsoft pulling a monopoly move , or perhaps another bigger picture is in place now \? let me know what you all think ! __eou__	User
PA	hi , note rewards users will no longer be able to use their facebook account to sign into rewards after february 5 , 2015 what happens when i transfer my bing rewards account so i sign in with a microsoft account instead of facebook \? if you transfer your account to a new bing rewards account that you sign into with a microsoft account , we ll move all of your credits , order history , status , invited friends , reward goal , etc to your new account if you already have a bing rewards account that you sign into with a microsoft account you ll need to transfer to that account we ll add the credits you ve earned in the account you sign into with facebook to the credits in your existing bing rewards account that s associated with a microsoft account your status , order history , etc will not move there may have been an issue with members having two accounts , losing credits when closing one account , etc it 's easier to keep track of the one account credits you might consider contacting bing rewards support team and ask them why __eou__	Agent

OQ	hi my system is as follows nokia lumia 2520 \( note , this is a tablet , not a mobile phone \) windows rt i have the above tablet and purchased the keyboard to accompany it the keyboard incidentally has a battery which complements the main battery in the tablet prior to a recent full system refresh , the battery meter displayed both on the windows 8 interface , but also in the notification area of the desktop recognised and displayed both batteries and gave a sensible total percentage charge for example , when both the tablet and keyboard batteries are quite fully charged , the overall charge is displayed as 100 or slightly less however , since the full system refresh , the overall charge percentage is making little sense for example , at the current time , charge percentages are as follows tablet battery 100 keyboard battery 1 overall charge 13 i am aware that the tablet battery provides significantly more battery time than the keyboard battery and so am confused as to why the overall charge displayed is so low prior to the full system refresh , i am very sure that in the scenario above for the tablet and keyboard battery charges , the overall charge would have more logically been far higher , perhaps at least 80 i did notice that the overall charge status in terms of 'plugged in charging not charging' seems to report the status of the keyboard battery , rather than the tablet battery and wonder if the battery meter is somehow inappropriately prioritising the keyboard battery , which is essentially a 'slave' battery would anybody therefore know why the above would be occurring and also perhaps how windows rt tends to handle dual batteries \? i can confirm that as of 19 01 16 , system update confirms the tablet is fully up to date , so i would assume that any previous fixes that may have been implemented are already installed thank you for your time best regards kim __eou__	User

FD_FQ_NF	hi brian thank you for your reply i ran the troubleshooter in step one , but the only problem that this identified was that the display was set too bright and which was automatically fixed i then used the commands in step two , which both ran in the command prompt successfully however , this does not appear to have affected the behaviour of the power meter i have noticed that despite the tablet being on charge for more than one hour , the keyboard battery charge has only moved from 6 to 7 in that time , which from my experience of how this previously charged , would be a very slow charging time i have also realised that despite the battery meter identifying that the keyboard battery is 'plugged in' and 'charging' , the ac adapter that plugs into the mains electrical socket is cold , which would perhaps indicate that no actual charging is taking place however , the tablet battery is able to charge and charges quickly and fully theevan keyboard itself in little more than one year old and has not been used to excess , with it likely only having been charged a relatively small number of times i would therefore be surprised if the battery had failed is it possible that in reality both batteries are fully charged , as evidenced by the cold ac adapter and that battery meter is displaying inaccurate information \? regards jasonkim __eou__	User
FD_PA	hi brian theevan battery meter seems now to have corrected itself , such that the status and icon suddenly changed to show that both batteries are now fully charged i would assume that your advice has fixed this , so thank you very much for your help best regards jasonkim __eou__	User

FD_PA	same deal and they just sent me a new keyboard unit last week however , the following reply was found on a forum it ca n't help us , but it explains it mine worked for the longest time , and if this guy is right , we now know why microsoft has left nokia owners and rt users in general to twist in the wind , though i have identified the issue is a missing driver no longer being served up by microsoft update device manager unknown device error 28 acpiqcom24a0 so after doing hard resets multiple times this keeps coming up evan driver that is eventually installed is dated 2006 not the 2013 to match the operating system those are able to get the nokia power keyboard to work initially is because the correct driver is installed new this driver was never loaded to microsoft windows update to be reinstalled matching the hardware configuration uncle wormie __eou__	Agent

PA	hi jenna56 , i should be able to shed some light on this , after having enjoyed this app for the past few months i 've got a slightly different issue today , though should be able to help your query as not sure you 've had the best responses so far i 've been using the photo 's app on my surface pro 4 successfully for the past few months it works great i just take photos on my mobile phone , they upload into one drive , and then hey presto i return everytime to the albums section in the photo 's app and i 've got a nice neat album of quality photo 's from the day indeed , not all the photos are present i noticed this and seems normal functionality i found this odd at first , though now i get how this works collections stores all your photos which is effectively your 'folders' albums is microsoft 's way of digesting the photos in your folder collection , to a user friendly , readily viewable album folder the photos app seems to cleverly apply some logic to remove duplicate photo 's , select the best photo 's , identify a choice few photos from similar images , remove blurred images , remove poorly lit images what 's is left seems to be the app 's best attempt to start a great album for you , to summarise the photo 's from the day in addition to this , it chooses a good album cover photo , and also applies the enhance to enhance all the images in the album the result \( and ultimate benefit \) , is that by doing nothing , you can just open up your album and immediately have available a good album set to view yourself or show to others if you want all photo 's just go to collections which is unfiltered so albums starts off an album for you based on the photo 's taken for that day i then 'optimise' the album by choosing edit in the top right corner , then click 'add or remove photos' the logic applied is excellent , although it does n't always get all the photos you want , so i manually select de select photos as appropriate i have found this really useful , as when taking photo 's i do have many duplicates and blurred ones i also have 100 's of photo directories , and going through each one is a \) very time consuming and b \) i do n't like to delete photo 's , so the album is a useful view on photo 's you want i find it great for showing kids parents in summary , it 's normal functionality just use collections if you prefer all photos i'm no expert in this btw , this is just how i 've been using it for info , i have a separate problem in that since the aug 2016 microsoft windows 10 update , i have now lost all my albums __eou__	Agent

NF	hi lisa , thanks for the reply ! i was able to do as you suggested and manually added the mailto part to the address and it opened right up in mac mail note that it defaults to opening up the edit hyperlink window with the web page or file tab selected , not the email address tab i did n't realize that at first and simply added mailto to the address field that reads link to an existing file or web page this worked though when i click ok , test and then go back to the edit window , the information updates and gets transferred to the correct email address tab so that 's good ! i did notice that it shows the mailto code in the actual cell of the worksheet instead of being hidden code when i go back in to check the edit hyperlink window it shows text to display with the mailto code , but the actual email address field shows the email address without the mailto code i can go back in manually and remove that mailto from the text to display field and it still works properly this is how a brand new email being added looks like in the edit hyperlink window there is no mailto code in either field so it must automatically add the proper code behind the scenes to function another thing to note is that when i go into one of the messed up emails and it opens automatically to the web page or file tab the text to display field shows http email address is removed for privacy \( for example \) so that is probably what is causing the problem so , my next question then is there a way to update multiple cells at one time \? i have hundreds of email addresses that need to be updated and editing manually would be very time consuming expensive thanks , james __eou__	User

PA	hi melanie , the issue can be reproduced , please refer to ron 's answer in this thread for more information excel vba dropdown items for comboboxes on userforms disappeared \( \? \) regards , joannesteven __eou__	Agent
FD_PA	hi brett , strange as this may sound , it 's actually good news if you do n't know already , microsoft has been testing a new visual basic for applications editor for office for mac in insider fast builds the test was very successful and everyone loves the new editor the only remaining part that needs to finished for the editor is the userform editor component that there is suddenly a new glitch in userforms is a strong indication that microsoft is working on userforms now so this makes me very happy of course , this is a big pain for you , and i can understand your scowl at my happiness steven pointed to ron 's thread ron submitted a bug report to microsoft , and you should , too use the smile button in excel and send a frown the squeaky wheel gets the grease ! meanwhile , for your production environment , i 'd say restore the most recent build that worked right \( probably 15 37 \) using time machine choose keep both also , turn autoupdate to manual , so it does n't trash your restored version of excel while i ca n't promise that running two different versions of excel wo n't cause other strange behaviors , it 's the best i can offer you for now in theory , you should n't even be able to do this , because office should be doing a checksum to make sure the install has n't been tampered with but it seems to work , anyway __eou__	Agent
FD_NF	i'm glad you mentioned my scowl it 's like you were reading my face as i read your post i get what you 're saying , and i 'd agree if this bug was only in fast or slow builds , not production i am aware glad they are working on the editor but fort this to make it to a production build is unacceptable unfortunately , rolling back via time machine is n't an option for 400 machines i 've reported this issue to the system admins in case it needs to be rolled back \( if it can \) userforms are the worst place for vba to fail because it 's the user interface users are less likely to care wo n't know if there 's a bug in non ui code this bug has the helpdesk phones ringing the people that use these macros are decision makers and they literally cannot use the macros that have been in place for years this is a major qa fail on microsoft 's part i hope the resolution is quick __eou__	User
FD	do you have a way to simply copy the previous build of excel to everyone 's applications folder \? it 's easy for me , but i'm just one person the glitch still is n't fixed in last week 's 15 39 pre beta build maybe in tomorrow 's build it will be fixed tomorrow 's insider fast build promises to be an amazing build i'm betting they upgrade the object model to version 16 , which should give the mac pivotcharts , 3d maps , the whole shebang ! ! btw , with that many macs in your domain , one of your power users should be on insider fast pre beta testing build if they were , this glitch would have been noticed and you would n't have deployed the 15 38 update , or microsoft would have known right away \( assuming you reported this promptly \) and would have fixed it before 15 38 came out heck , anyone with a spirit of adventure should try this week 's insider fast build \( absolutely not for production \) it will have lots of bugs , for sure , and it will be an amazing build __eou__	Agent
FQ	i'm not the sys admin , so i'm not sure of the distribution method that they use i 've reported this issue to them so they can prepare for a roll back if that is deemed necessary \( and possible \) that 's where i 'll leave it i will test tomorrow 's insider fast build hopefully it will be resolved there am i correct that there is generally one production release per month \? thanks , brett __eou__	User
FD_IR	yes you 're right about the schedule it 's not a hard and fast thing , but generally insider fast weekly \( sometimes more frequently \) insider slow monthly comes out about a week before general release if there are no show stoppers , this becomes general release in a week general release monthly btw did you see that the next insider build is going to have a lot of new features \? i'm hoping we get object model 16 which means we get all the missing features of excel for windows ! __eou__	Agent
FD	honestly , the only feature i'm interested in at this point is userform editing i 've been using the windows version in a vm because it is missing on the mac side running a whole os is quite a lot of overhead for a missing feature , and i'm looking forward to being able to run mac only again i have played with the latest version they made it look and behave just like the windows version i'm not excited about that , but it 's good to unify it quite frankly , i'm just happy they 're working on it still __eou__	User

FD	i use latexit app to produce beautiful latex equation when using office 2011 in macos x it worked fine but i'm not able to drag and drop latexit equations using pdf or eps format into a powerpoint \( 2016 macosx \) slide anymore what a surprise is that i still can do this from latexit to word 2016 from word i can drag the very same equation and drop it into powerpoint 2016 macosx why on earth i ca n't do this straightforward from latexit to powerpoint \? is this a bug or a special feature tailored to annoy macosx users \? in the very same line of thought why ca n't we use a pen with tablet in word onenote in a macos \? i have paid the very same for a version of office 2016 that is advertised as compatible with windows version it clearly is n't and that 's it \? __eou__	User
PA	instead of drag and drop , try using the insert picture picture from file command my guess is that latexit is producing non standard files that the powerpoint 2016 for mac import filter is having trouble parsing you can also click on the small smiley face icon in the upper right corner of the program window , choose tell us what can be better and describe the problem in detail submitting sends the report to the mac programmers there are no apple os x tablets , only ios ones there are many styluses \( styli \? \) made for the ipad , there 's no reason why you ca n't use one with powerpoint mobile for ipad office 2016 for mac is compatible with windows versions that means the files can be opened in windows , that does n't mean it has exactly the same features __eou__	Agent
NF	that 's an interesting approach , but latexit is designed for drag and drop capability using vector graphics if you have to save it as a file first , then re open it , it 's a really long workaround for those of us who regularly drag hundreds of equations into a single powerpoint presentation i can use raster versions , but on resizing , they look rubbish i have clicked the smiley icon and reported it , which appears to be the best suggestion at the moment i think i'm re downgrading again until you fix it __eou__	Agent
FD_PA	this is a user to user help forum , so any suggestions you have for microsoft will probably not be read to get their notice , please post a suggestion at the word for mac user voice forum word for mac user voice there is also this thread with suggestions about getting latexit equations into word embed latex math equations into microsoft word i have to admit , you 'll be at a disadvantage using word for mac it 's always microsoft 's poor relation , since they want everyone to use windows running bootcamp or parallels , then installing word for windows will get you better results __eou__	Agent

PA	you ca n't delete the predefined templates , if that is what you are asking what you can do is the following in word , click file options general and clear the check mark next to show the start screen when this application starts you will still see a large selection of templates when you click file new , though if you mostly create new , blank documents , you can use the keyboard shortcut ctrl n __eou__	Agent

OQ	hello asking on behalf of a friend who 's recently came out of a long term relationship and is now being harassed by the ex after blocking his phone number , social media accounts and the like , he 's taken to using skype to call her mobile phone number however , the number she receives is always unknown on her mobile and thus she cannot block it i 've read that apparently skype calls will generate a new outgoing number each time , so that might be why but anyway is there a way to block the numbers to stop that from happening \? __eou__	User
PA	some android phone have it builtin go to setting , call settings , call blocking settings , block mode and tap on block unknown calls and messages and then tick block privet calls iphone has no block unknown or private numbers settings so you will need an app one of the best ones out there is calls blacklist \( free with adds \) or calls blacklist pro \( pay with no adds \) that come in android , iso and windows calls blacklist is easy to setup you just go to settings in the app blocking , tick private and unknown numbers and that 's it i would recommend turning in sms and setting that up to unknown numbers as well but it will not block mms as it is data sent my dad did this for me when i was having problems with an ex and it worked __eou__	Agent

IR_PA	you mean log into the same machine remotely in separate sessions so one session is not affected by the other \? windows 7 will allow only one session active at a time in the betas it was allowed but that went away there may still be hacks out there otherwise you can use remote desktop with an application \( android \) called remote rdp \( at least that is my favored android app for this \) to access your machine remotely and the screen will be locked at the remote site \( no one there can see what you are doing \) however , again , without hacking \( and i am not sure it is still possible to do that \) you can only have one active session on a windows 7 system at a time , afaik __eou__	Agent

OQ	earlier this year i started noticing that certain keys would n't always take i would be typing and would realize that the shift key or space had not performed its function but if i pressed deliberately and firmly , it would work over time it seemed to get worse , or perhaps i just noticed it more the right shift key and space tend to be the worst , but 4 on the number row and sometimes numbers on the keypad also do not want to work the problem is random and sporadic sometimes so bad i have difficulty even typing out a short message other times i can use the computer for days with minimal issue the toshiba troubleshooter and some online sources advise uninstalling the keyboard driver and restarting the computer i have done this a number of times sometimes it seems like it may help for a little while , but the problem always comes back i'm out of warranty , so they refuse to let me even talk to tech support without charging me in the list of drivers for my computer , they do not have a keyboard driver i 've seen indications that some people have trouble with conflicts with a lenovo synaptics driver my touchpad is elan , not synaptics , so that is n't it \( although i did try uninstalling and reinstalling the touchpad driver anyway , just in case \) i booted ubuntu from a flash drive and had no problems with the keyboard again , with any test it 's hard to be sure , given the random and sporadic nature of this issue , but it seems pretty sure that it 's a software problems that only developed after the windows 10 creator update based on other tips i found online , i have tried removing the battery and waiting for several minutes before starting the computer , and plugging in a usb keyboard , typing and removing the usb keyboard the problem always comes back it seems my next course of action may be to factory reset the computer and hope that fixes it although not only is that a major hassle , but i wonder if , once the computer is restored and updates , the problem will not simply return does anyone know where i can find a satellite s50 c keyboard driver \? toshiba has let me down and i ca n't seem to find anything i 've found a few windows 7 drivers for older toshiba laptops , but i need something explicitly designed to work on windows 10 ideally something for my model of laptop or is there some other solution to this issue \? __eou__	User
PA	hi chad , if you re having issues with your keyboard , it can be due to an incompatible driver or broken system components after installing the update let s isolate this concern by performing a clean boot this troubleshooting technique will help us identify if there are applications that s causing your keyboard not to work accordingly please click here for the instructions once you re in the clean boot state , try to check the performance of your keyboard if the issue has been resolved note after the troubleshooting , refer to this section how to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting on the same support article to boot the computer in normal setup once the issue has been resolved if you ll get the same result , try to install the latest windows 10 creators update build that may contain possible fixes and enhancements check this article to find out and install the latest build additionally , you can search and install the satellite s50 c keyboard driver from the manufacturer s website let us know the result after performing the suggested steps __eou__	Agent
FD_FQ_NF	thanks for the reply i tried the clean boot i experienced the keyboard problem again within minutes windows update says my device is up to date i tried manually downloading and installing one of the updates , and had an error that is was already installed as i said , toshiba does not list a keyboard driver for my model of computer you can see this yourself by following the link you sent me i have been unable to find any compatible windows 10 keyboard driver it 's entirely possible that replacing the driver with a good driver would fix the problem if i could find one any other ideas \? __eou__	User
PA	as an additional step , you may reach out with the manufacturer of your computer to install any available bios \( basic input output system \) firmware this may help resolving the issue with the performance of your keyboard in case that you already have the latest bios firmware on your device and the issue still persists , we suggest that you perform a clean install for windows 10 this will ensure that your computer will be clean from possible software conflicts please click here for the steps note make sure to back up your files so that you ll be able to restore it afterwards also , you 'll need to reinstall all the programs that you currently have once you re done with the clean install let us know the result after performing the suggested steps above __eou__	Agent
PF	i tried updating the bios i ran into some issues , but once i search intel 's site for and downloaded their intel chipset driver , i was then able to successfully install the windows bios update from toshiba , going from 1 3 to 1 4 i rebooted the computer and immediately experienced the keyboard problem again then , just a few days ago , there was a windows 10 update available i had already checked for updates several times last week , so this was only published very recently , after i had started this thread i installed that and it seems ok ! so far i have n't had any keyboard issues i'm worried that it may come back \( again , the problem occurred randomly \) but after trying it for a couple days i think and hope the computer is fixed now yay ! perhaps this latest windows 10 update did the trick or maybe i needed the combination of a bios update and a windows update , who knows \? i'm just happy that , for now the keyboard is working __eou__	User

OQ	i have a curious case with skype recently i have oneplus 3t , and i when i try calling a specific contact on skype , and i am on mobile data , that contact ca n't hear me he can hear me clearly when i am on any wi fi , but ca n't when i am on lte i tried switching to 3g or 2g , but it still wo n't work i tried rebooting \( it 's been awhile \) , reinstalling skype , deleting and adding that contact , but nothing helped the only thing that did help is to add that contact to another call \( group call \) and then dropping the extra contact only then i could be heard while on lte help is appreciated ! __eou__	User
PA	hi sheila , good day ! please be advised that if skype detects a weak connection , it will reduce the quality to try and stop the call from dropping altogether with that being said , we strongly advised you to use wi fi instead of mobile data as skype have required bandwidth that will depend on the type of calls you want to make for more information you can check this link https support skype com en faq fa1417 if you have further questions , kindly reply to this thread thank you ! marites p skype community moderator __eou__	Agent
CQ	this is not particularly what this is about my lte connection is fast enough to handle anything also , i can talk to anybody else with my lte connection on skype , whereas there is only one contact who can only hear me only when i use wifi __eou__	User
PA	hi sheila , since you confirmed that you have a fast connection , the problem may be with the other person on the call you can ask them to try to use another connection when making a call just to add , wi fi is the one we highly recommended because it has a stable connection unlike mobile data , wherein it varies on the location for the signal it can provide thank you ! marites p skype community moderator __eou__	Agent

FD_PA	as of the moment bing does n't have offer that allows other users to submit their photos i suggest that you keep an eye with rewards , they sometimes release offers that allows a user to contribute photos with bing if you want to see all bing images , you may go here you may follow them thru bing blogs , twitter , facebook , and instagram hard work and a desire to succeed were the two main ingredients to any successful endeavor __eou__	Agent

PA	hi , this issue may have occurred due to several reasons such as your rewards credit counter may have stopped counting if you 've reached your credit earning maximum , or if your browser is in inprivate mode in internet explorer or an equivalent mode in other browsers where the browser doesn t collect information please see the frequently asked questions on this topic meanwhile , we suggest that you clear your data files and cache on your browser then sign in to bing using your microsoft account that you used to sign up for bing rewards your rewards credit counter should re appear if you are still having trouble , submit your question to our customer support team let us know if you need further assistance __eou__	Agent
FD_NF	being at zero out of one hundred and fifty points is kind of a good sign that i have n't hit the maximum amount of points , since i have n't earned any points the bit about private mode also is totally wrong since points can still be earned as long as you are signed into the correct account , i know that since i used to use one of those modes when i was forced to use a public computer for a time and in any case , that is n't the issue since i was n't in private mode it also was n't an issue with the counting not appearing , it was a problem with searches not granting points , but it seems to have solved itself again without any help __eou__	User

OQ	i have a series of powerpoint presentations that are essentially troubleshooting guides with shapes that link to work instructions , videos , etc that are contained in other slides they are on the larger side \( between 50 and 200mb \) and have a few hundred slides each the presentations are stored in a onedrive for business folder when i try to view them using powerpoint online , the pages load very slowly when i click on a link , and occasionally the program times out and crashes this seems to happen regardless of file size or slide content i think i 've narrowed it down to an issue with the distance the link has to travel i created two test presentations , one with 100 slides and one with 5 they each have a title slide , a rectangle shape on slide 2 with a link to the last slide , and a slide that says the end at the end presentations a and b are 139 and 44kb , respectively clicking the link on slide 2 on a takes about 10 20 seconds to load the last slide , while b takes about 1 second once they are opened and i have navigated to that slide , the links are instantaneous is there some other way to link to different slides that wo n't cause this problem \? or , as an alternative , is there a way to cache the whole presentation up front so there is no wait time when links are clicked \? __eou__	User
PA	once they are opened and i have navigated to that slide , the links are instantaneous might that be at least a workaround \? on the first slide , add a link to the last slide and there , a link back to the first slide from what you 've mentioned , that might be enough to preload cache the presentation and give you faster responses for the remainder of the show not ideal , but if it works , you at least know exactly when you 're going to get hit with the delay and can control when it hits you __eou__	Agent
PF	for some reason did n't think to extrapolate that notion into a way to cache the presentation i tried this , it gave me a dialogue box when it timed out , which i just closed and then manually advanced the slide using the navigator at the bottom of the screen and presentation seems to work normally these presentations will be on screens in a factory 24 7 \( or at least windowed \) so spending a little time up front the first time it 's open is n't the worst thing in the world thank you for the help __eou__	User

OQ	our charity 's website \( https jenniferann org \) is not showing correctly in bing search listings the site is properly configured with the title of jennifer ann 's group which is the name of our charity founded in 2006 however bing has changed the listing to instead show murder of jennifer ann crecente official site unfortunately , yes , jennifer ann crecente was murdered in 2006 and it was her death which prompted the formation of this 501 \( c \) \( 3 \) organization but this does not excuse bing unilaterally misrepresenting us in their search results our work is not focused on jennifer 's murder but rather helping other young people recognize and avoid abusive dating relationships when people search for information about jennifer ann 's group they should be able to find our website not be presented with an official site for jennifer 's murder for two days we have sent multiple requests to bing microsoft through their automated systems as well as to their twitter accounts in an attempt to correct the manner in which our organization is being misrepresented there has been no response is there an official process to correct this \? or a person who can assist \? is there a procedure we can follow to ensure this does not happen again \? while we recognize that this may not seem like a significant issue to some , it is terribly frustrating and hurtful for those of us who miss jennifer and are working every day to help other adolescents avoid her fate the fact that bing would ignore our content and replace our name with one of its own choosing is genuinely distressing and offensive the work we do is very important to us and it is not acceptable for bing to define our work like this please note we are aware of the information regarding bing 's selection of a title for a web page \( https blogs bing com webmaster 2014 06 23 how does bing choose the title for my web page \) our html and associated metatags title content reflect our name as jennifer ann 's group bing appears to have used content from wikipedia to select the title they have applied __eou__	User

PA	for starters , skype has no phone technical support number performing a more thorough search should inform you that the number you are dialing is a scam number out to steal your information and money they have no access to your skype account or your computer unless you provide them with that information i have had a skype number for over a decade if you just set up a skype number it may take some time to activate initially \( possibly 24 hours or so \) if you are online in skype and people call that phone number from their mobile or landline number , your skype client should ring a skype number is an inbound only subscription a skype number by itself does include any ability to dial phone numbers for free that still requires credit or a subscription you may want to determine whether inbound call issues are solely related to the client version on your phone or its sleep status having a static client that is on 24x7 may prove to be more reliable for inbound calls as variables are reduced you may want to try a desktop or the web client just to see if calls are getting through on those skype clients if you need to get a hold of skype customer service , you can do so over live chat to do so , contact skype customer service for assistance to reach that support you simply need to choose the correct topic , sub topic and click on next to get a live chat option the best topic and sub topic for this issue would probably be payments orders help with a subscription __eou__	Agent

OQ	i'm using powerpoint 365 on win10 i was creating a presentation where i had previously numbered the slides i wanted to re use slides not only from another preso i had but also input from someone else in each of the cases where i copied information in , the slide numbers would not render no matter what i did my only solution was to create a new slide after the bad one , copy data in and then i had my slide number so the only way i can be sure to get slide numbers to render if copying from another deck is to copy it in once , then copy it again this seems crazy what , if anything , am i doing wrong here \? this seems like it 'd be pretty straightforward __eou__	User

OQ	i had to update office and now features in ppt are gone i was able to use the recording tab \( which is gone \) and then record audio over a full screen presentation , save it , then upload it to an editing program now , it looks like ppt is forcing me to record one slide at a time with some icon showing on the screen , that is not in full screen mode i tried to do a continuous voice recording during slide transitions and it seems ppt wants to mute down the audio during the slide transition and it cannot be viewed in full screen mode the recordings look like they are being done in edge which is horrible i would like to know how to record over a full screen ppt presentation where i control the slide transitions , without a speaker icon showing up just like i was able to do before updating office i am not looking to record each slide one by one or having the slides being recorded in any other mode other than full screen presentation having an icon present on the slides any work around to get back to what worked well in recording over a full screen presentation \? __eou__	User

OQ	i purchased and installed ms office 2016 it worked perfectly until recently \( no new updates or anything installed on my laptop recently \) it has started displaying an error message as below if i click repair now , it goes away until i next open an excel file if i click close , the file closes without saving changes i noticed that it has started saying excel \( unlicensed product \) at the top but i bought it from microsoft online and have my product key etc how do i fix this \? __eou__	User
PA	hi patrick , the error message that you ve encountered may occur due to corrupted system files or a software conflict has occurred with excel to help us isolate this concern , we suggested that you use the microsoft office configuration analyzer tool 2 2 this will identify the root cause of the issue and will provide possible solutions at the same time to download the tool , please click here and go through the install instruction section for additional information on how to use it let us know the result after performing the suggested steps __eou__	Agent
FD	well this does kinda solve the problem however , i could n't find the how to resolve this problem link in the analyzer tool also , it automatically uninstalled my ms office , so i reinstalled it and it is fine now the analyzer tool \( if it has a resolve button \) should clearly indicate how to fix problems , i was clicking around for about 15min then it disappeared and i noticed that it uninstalled the office program when i did the suggested tips of modifying the program to possibly find the bug through an online update i would rather just uninstall then reinstall the software next time no \? __eou__	User
PA	if your office applications were uninstalled automatically by the microsoft office tool analyzer , this means that it is the solution for the issue that you 've encountered it 's still recommended to run this tool before uninstalling the programs since there are possibilities that other fixes will be provided we 're just here if you need further help __eou__	Agent

FD_PA	hi candace , good day ! please be advised that you are being asked for a parental permission is because the system detected that your age on file is below 13 years of age that s why it was categorized as a child account but you don t have to worry about this one because we can change the date of birth on your account , so you can have the correct age on file first option is to create a new microsoft account with a different email address username and a correct date of birth and i believe that this is the fastest and the most convenient way for you or if you really want to retain that email address username , we can change the date of birth of it using these options option 1 provide a valid credit card number note microsoft can only accept a us credit card microsoft account was created with a us address , but you have a credit card form another country region , this option won t work use option 2 or 3 to fix this problem if you re a parent trying to change your child s birth date , this option won t appear option 2 send us a fax option 3 send postal mail microsoft account child age verification microsoft corporation 1 microsoft way redmond , wa 98052 if you have further questions about your account verification do not hesitate to contact us back if you have further questions , kindly reply to this thread thank you ! marites p skype community moderator __eou__	Agent

OQ	i am creating a word file to upload to amazon kdp paperback i am running into an enormous amount of difficulties with the page numbering almost all the page numbers are displaying on every other page i do n't know if this is helpful , but i also seem to have created 4 different headers and footers i do n't have any idea how this happened could this be affecting my page numbering problems \? thank you __eou__	User
PA	if you have the different odd evenpages box checked in the options section of the header and footer toosl design tab of the ribbon , you will need to insert the page numbering field \( s \) into both the odd and even page header or footer note the each section of a document can have up to three different headers and footers if the different first page box is checked first page even page odd page or , without the different odd even pages box checked first page primary header \( appears on all pages except the first page of a section \) without the different first page and different odd even pages boxes checked , you only get the one primary headerfooter that will appear on all pages of a section in a document with mutliple sections , all of the possible header and footers can be different from one section to the next , though you can have each of them the same as the corresponding header or footer in the previous section by clicking on the link to previous button in the navigation section of the header and footer tools design tab __eou__	Agent

FD_NF	thank you for your reply and the information on how to now do it as opposed to how it used to be done however , i must say that from the client 's standpoint \( mine \) the only thing accomplished was that several steps were added to accomplish the same thing why on earth were the changes made when in the beginning , all we had to do was right click on any image save picture as and just click save as you had already included a name or description or id number or whatever now we have to click on the image , then right click it and so forth so why were hte extra steps added if you do not mind my asking \? __eou__	User

FD_NF	okay , please understand , i am not trying to give anyone a hard time however i have a lot of experience with software and pc 's and i sincerely believe that most people companies have forgotten the main primary reason for the development of personal computers to begin with and that was for the purpose of improving efficiency in doing day to day things if this does not apply to you , then please direct it to someone who does have responsibility for this area and let 's get this addressed and corrected to improve efficiency is that acceptable the situation is that in the beginning , we , the clients came to bing and searched out images among those images , we the clients wanted to save some of the images on our systems for many reasons , some legit , some not , but for now , lets through out the non legitimate reasons for capturing saving images from the net onto our computers and so , once we entered the filters for the images and the search results were returned , we would scan all of the results and those we liked wanted to keep , we simply could right click on the image , then click on save as and automatically , something would appear in the file name area which always began with th and then a series of numbers of alpha characters now , yesterday , or last nght to be exact , i read your answer on how to get an auto name which is more involved as it requires more steps so , i came here today to see what can be done to get us back to where we were originally thus eliminating steps and making it easy , thus more efficient however , as i prepared this reply , to insure i was using the correct terms where needed , it has all changed again ! here is what happened i went to bing com in the search box , i entered waterfalls and hit the search button and then immediately received a page full of images of different waterfalls i went to one of them , and right clicked on it and the dialog box came up to save the image and there was a name in the file name box but , i tried it again , on a different picture and the same name was there i tried to follow the directions from yesterday which was to put the cursor on the picture and left click it nothing nothing at all , period apparently someone might be reading these exchanges and is doing something to make changes but now once again , i am lost who at bing do we need to contact to request we get back to the original point whereby when images are shown in search results and we wish to save images all we have to do is right click on the image , the click on save as and something will automatically appear uniquely for each image in the file name box so all we then have to do is click on the save button and it is done \? how do we request this change for the purpose of efficiency and to whom do we make the request \? lastly and again , please , i am not attempting to be a smart buy why when something like this is entered into the community is n't someone from bing reading these issues and deciding , oh that belongs to the development group and then forwards it to that group so the actually experts are answering the issue while also addressing what can or cannot be done to make changes for the purposes of efficiency i sincerely do not mean to be harsh , hard , or a smart mouth person being mean i am a retired qc engineer and thus spent a good portion of my life addressing problems from the standpoint of the cause and especially how to correct so it never happens again and in a very efficient manner if a person is making 50 hour working on fixing problems , you want the problem fixed as fast as possible but in a very efficient manner and in a manner that insures it does not have to be addressed again or you are not being efficient , correct \? so , lastly , who do we address regarding this problem to get it fixed \( it should never have been changed from the way it was \) so we the customers can save pictures images from bing without having to make 10 steps when it can be done in 2 or 3 steps \? thank you for your consideration and time ! __eou__	User

PA	you can only resize a window that is not maximized in the top right corner of every window , regardless of what application it is , you see icons to minimize , maximize restore and the x for exit when a window is maximized , it cannot be resized you need to click the maximize restore icon to restore the window it is a toggle switch the first screenshot shows what it looks like in a maximized window that takes up the whole screen the second screenshot shows what it looks like if the window is not maximized this window 's borders can be dragged another quick way in windows 7 and higher to see windows side by side is to select one window , hold down the window key on your keyboard and hit the right arrow that will send the window to the right hand side of the screen and it will take up half of the monitor in windows 10 you now can click any of the other open windows and it will be arranged on the left hand side of the screen in older windows versions you need to repeat the step to select a window and use the windows key with the left arrow __eou__	Agent

FD_PA	without any details it 's hard to tell from a screen shot , but my guess is that the image was inserted scaled to fit the slide size at the time the slide size then was changed to a3 , in which case there was a prompt about scaling the image yes was selected the program did exactly what it was supposed to do the reason for the straps is that the original slide size a3 have different aspect ratios the result is that the image was scaled but was scaled proportionately in order to avoid distortion that 's why it spans the width but not the height of the slide in these examples the slide on the left illustrates the image scaled to fit the default widescreen size , the slide on the right is the same slide after changing to a3 iow , changing the slide size after adding content is like having a custom tailored suit made , then gaining losing 25 pounds growing 3 inches taller the tailor can alter the waist but ca n't lengthen the trousers or the jacket , so it is n't the tailor 's fault that the suit no longer fits \) __eou__	Agent

NF_OQ	powerpoint for mac version 15 32 macos sierra version 10 12 5 error the image part with relationship id rid2 was not found in the file not good ! ! ! ! just upgraded from office 2008 for the mac where powerpoint was stable and reliable have a 91 slide powerpoint presentation to give in another city at an event attended by 5000 people in a few days and out of nowhere , the images in powerpoint are gone , replaced with the error message the image part with relationship id rid2 was not found in the file turning off norton did nothing to correct the problem having to change all of the photographs as an alternative is not a solution because there is no assurance that whatever created this problem , wo n't happen again unreliable this is unacceptable is there a fix \? if there is no fix , it means that powerpoint for mac is unreliable , therefore unusable i need some help here , otherwise this has to be totally rebuilt in mac powerpoint 2008 or keynote is there a fix for this instead of shucking powerpoint 2016 this represents hundreds of hours and i'm sure i am not the only one with this problem this is a real problem any suggestions as to a fix , other than change picture \? thanks in advance __eou__	User
CQ_IR_PA	hi joshua wb , we understand it was a poor experience and sorry you were impacted i hope you can stick with it and continue to troubleshoot the issue with us to better understand the situation , i 'd like to confirm the following things 1 is the issue only related to one specific ppt file or all files \? do you store them in cloud storage or local drive \? 2 when do you encounter this issue , after some office or mac os updates \? 3 is this ppt created on your mac or other devices \? you can try changing several pictures in this problematic presentation save the change and then open the presentation next day , check if these pictures will change back to the error message best regards , timbrenda __eou__	Agent
CQ	hi joshua wb , are there any updates \? you may share with us some updates when you have time regards , timbrenda __eou__	Agent
PA	unfortunately , once you 've seen this error message , it means that powerpoint has corrupted the file there 's no \( currently known \) way to retrieve the lost pictures , other than reverting to a previously saved version of the file , if you have one if you decide to reconstruct the file in ppt 2016 , there are a few steps you can take to avoid or possibly eliminate the possibility of this happening again first make sure your copy of ppt has all available updates next when working on the file , always open from save to a copy of the file on your local hard drive never open from save to files on removable storage \( thumb drives , etc \) copy the file from removable storage to your hard drive , open it from there , save it , then move it back to removable storage if need be on the hard drive , do n't store the file in a location that 's automatically backed up synched or temporarily turn off the auto backup synching while you 're working on the file regularly save the file to a new name to give yourself a trail of saved files in good condition to go back to in case the one you 're working on gets whacked myfile 001 myfile 002 and so on __eou__	Agent
FD	brenda , steveallison , thank you for taking the time to answer my question luckily , i still had the file that was created on the fail proof standalone version of 2008 powerpoint for mac otherwise i would have had to recreate the entire file it was my first time using powerpoint 2016 for mac which i just bought with the office suite and i'm not very happy i 've never had this kind of fail with reliable office 2008 i will follow the suggestions you 've made here , but certainly not without apprehension i also bought the newest version of office for windows but have n't used it yet i imagine , the same rules apply i hope there is a fix for this soon thank you again for your suggestions and response i appreciate it wynne __eou__	User
FD_PA	brenda , here are some answers 1 is the issue only related to one specific ppt file or all files \? do you store them in cloud storage or local drive \? i just started using pp 2016 for mac , and have only created two files one was an earlier saved version of the same pp file \( just in case \) both files became corrupted they are stored locally , on my internal hard drive , not on a peripheral drive or on off site server 2 when do you encounter this issue , after some office or mac os updates \? no mac os updates occurred and i'm pretty sure pp was not updated i was just working on the files i have a 500gb internal drive , which is down to 45gb , and i thought maybe that affected it there were a number of other applications open 3 is this ppt created on your mac or other devices \? the ppt was created only on the mac i was going to convert it to keynote so i could play it on my ipad it might just be better to use pp in its native setting \( on a pc \) wynne __eou__	User
PA	if 2016 , fully updated , on a windows computer is an option , i 'd go for that this same problem reared its head on the windows side some time back and now seems to be fixed i do n't recall seeing any complaints about it for quite some time , while it seems to pop up fairly often here among mac users who have 2016 earlier mac versions seem immune to it __eou__	Agent
PA	hi joshua wb , you may try updating your office suite to the latest version and then check if newly created ppt files have the same issue if the latest version works well , i suggest you modify those two problematic files monitor if they will run into the issue with the latest version of powerpoint for mac best regards , timbrenda __eou__	Agent

PA	hi jennifer , welcome to bing community ! i understand that you want your business to show up on the bing listings if your listing is verified , it will typically take up to 14 days for business information to update on bing listing search results and rankings can change due to a number of factors that are not directly in the control of the user however , you may improve your results by keeping your listing up to date by adding specific and relevant categories , a detailed and relevant description of your business , photos , and professional contacts our recommendation is to apply as much business listing information as possible to improve your overall listing relevancy , which may potentially impact your listing rank if you want to talk with a bing places for business support , please visit this link then click the support link at the bottom of the page if you want to report data issues in bing maps please visit this link hope this address your concern thank you for using bing ! __eou__	Agent
CQ	getting verified does n't help as far as i can tell microsoft does n't take whether a business is registered in bing local into account when giving search results my business has been open since march i registered with bing local in august and confirmed i'm listed under the category motorcycle shops there are fewer than ten such shops in toronto , but i'm not showing up in the top thirty seriously there are florists , insurance companies , long closed businesses and out of town businesses showing ahead of me on bing local when i search specifically for toronto motorcycle shops , about eight listings show up when i select show all businesses mine is n't on it , but a few ebike dealers are , a long defunct harley dealer and a burger joint i can only conclude that registering with bing is a waste of time i'm paying for bing ads and that dies slightly better whatever algorithmic bing uses for search , being registered or currently in business are not factors i fell sorry for doctors who show up under the undertaker listings __eou__	Agent
IR	alyssa b , i have a client that is a clear contender in his area being at the top of organic results for google , bing yahoo he also has 4x the amount of yelp reviews than any of his competitors the problem i am having is that he does n't show up at all in the bing local this is very frustrating since he is a clear contender when he first approached me , i assumed he did n't create a bing places account and that was the only problem unfortunately i found out that he had created one , and he created it months and months ago the next thing i'm going to check for him is to make sure all the information is consistent since i understand this can throw off search engines , however he said he made sure everything is consistent other than these steps , i have no idea what i should do next to fix the problem i would appreciate any advice please help dg __eou__	Agent
FD_PA	here 's one curious thing that i discovered i 've been trying all the things listed to get my store to show up the obvious search terms are toronto motorcycle shop no luck there 's a hamburger joint with motorcycle in its name , some insurance brokers that offer motorcycle insurance , several out of town shops and some that are closed , but i'm nowhere i change the search to just motorcycle shop which lets bing decide the location and i show up right at the top now i happen to be in toronto , so i do n't know why using that word would cause my listing to be excluded my address is consistently shown as being in toronto you might be interested that google has its own peculiarity including toronto or not makes no difference , but i do n't show up for searches for motorcycle shops at all i show up fairly high if i search for motorcycle stores and when i show up my google listing describes my store as a motorcycle shop of course the trouble is that i think most people will search for toronto motorcycle shop and not some odd variant i think that the local search function from both companies is seriously screwed up the only thing i 've found that works is paying for advertising that 's probably what they want us to do anyway __eou__	Agent

PA	hi , welcome to microsoft community i understand that you wanted to disable ip based search results from bing basically this is a backend based configuration just like other websites and search engines however you may override it from your end by properly selecting your appropriate market selecting markets would give you different results based on local cultural norms and sensibilities , restrictions and laws of that particular country for example , indexed results when us market is selected would be different from the results other countries or markets are selected like china or the middle east if the browser does not accept your market selection , then you may need to allow cookies to remember your configuration allowing cookies in ie 1 open internet explorer 2 click tools from the menu bar 3 choose internet options from the dropdown menu 4 click the privacy tab 5 hit the advanced button 6 make sure that the following options are checked a override automatic cookie handling b accept under first party cookies c accept under third party cookies d always allow session cookies 7 click ok to close the advanced privacy settings window select the apply then ok buttons to close the internet options window i hope i have clear things out keep using microsoft community forums for your questions around bing cheers ! __eou__	Agent

NF_OQ	this is my first time downloading skype for android i 've been using it for years on desktop my 'android skype contacts list' contains all the people from my 'android contacts list' , plus it syncs my list of skype contacts from the desktop version the entries from my 'android contacts list' \( there 's 100 's \) , nearly all have a blue 'invite' button next to their name in android skype how do you delete or hide these entries from your android skype contact list \? i only want to display want the contacts which are synced from the desktop version of skype also , a separate issue , on the desktop version my contacts are sorted into 'contact lists' the android version does not support these \? thanks __eou__	User
IR_PA	hello holly , welcome to skype community forum based from your post , it seems that you sync your android contacts to your skype application on your android device , but if you want to un sync it , can you try to reinstall the skype application and sign in normally and do not sync the android contacts to your app you can share us your ideas and reaction about the app by sending us your feedback here 's an article how to send feedback for the new skype let me know if you need further help regards , __eou__	Agent
FD	thank you for your reply i deleted the app data and started installation again , and chose 'deny' in the part which asked to access my contacts as you suggested , this fixed the problem of having 100 's of entries and duplicates in my skype contacts list however , i should stress to others reading this thread that the app does n't use the word 'sync' during set up it is just the normal 'allow skype to access your contacts' permission usually you would grant apps this permission during install , and then things like syncing and managing contacts would have options in the app itself in the privacy settings , the app does have the option 'sync your address book' , which is enabled by default \( hence my problem \) but if you subsequently disable it \( after allowing the app to access your address book \) it does not remove the entries added already this app currently has no other options to manage your contacts __eou__	User

OQ	old word docs become unix executable file and i get error message that the file type is blocked from opening in this version , which is the latest office for mac the message also states that if i feel secure about the file , you can open \( it \) by clicking open onthe file menu __eou__	User
PA	i get the impression that these are very old files \) the deprecated file format is n't directly supported by office 2011 so os x ca n't associate them with the respective program that 's why it 's imposing the unix exe icon further , even though os x is guessing that word should be used , word is balking because of the file format one of the reasons it was abandoned is security related have you tried doing as the message suggests \? launch word , then use file open to see if word will open the document it may cooperate or at least allow the option to recover text in the latter case , all formatting graphic content would be excluded if either works , use save as to save a new copy in the current docx file format otherwise , the only options i know of would be take the files to a mac or pc running a version of word several generations older than office 2007 , or locate translation software or an online service that can convert the files for you __eou__	Agent

FD_PA	deleting conversation history on one device does not delete the history from any other devices each of the devices skype is installed on has it 's own local history storage and the history must be deleted locally on this particular device skype installation also , note that in microsoft skype for windows 10 \( skype uwp \) application , there is no in build option to remove the locally saved conversation history if you want to delete the entire conversation history on skype uwp , then you will have manually to delete the main db file where the history is saved location of the main db database file used by skype uwp is localappdata packagesmicrosoft skypeapp kzf8qxf38zg5clocalstate skype name main db __eou__	Agent

OQ	i need write an excel formula to calculate a charge rate based on the following criteria note that cwt is equal to the total pounds divided by 100 0 1710 lbs 7 cwt 1711 3330 lbs 6 cwt 3331 and greater 5 cwt example 1500 lbs would be 1500 100 7 105 the only variable tracked on the spreadsheet is the total pounds therefore , all other variables must be contained in the formula i have tried to create a nested if formula but ca n't seem to get the syntax right any assistance would be greatly appreciated __eou__	User
PA	huh , my nested if would be \( assuming number of pounds is in cell a1 \) if \( a1 1711 , a1 7 , if \( a1 3331 , a1 6 , a1 5 \) \) note that since the second if is only called if a1 1711 you do n't need to make sure it is over 1710 you could also use an ifs ifs \( a1 1711 , a1 7 , a1 3331 , a1 6 , a1 3330 , a1 5 \) \( ifs is a special form of if designed for several if statements to slightly reduce the amount of nesting , if will check each if in turn and return that result if true , otherwise it will go to the next if \) __eou__	Agent
FQ	thank you for your response i think where i am getting tripped up is the second condition is a between so that if the pounds are between 1711 and 3330 then the amount charged per cwt is 6 how would i account for the two conditions in the second nested if statement \? __eou__	User
FD_PA	the trick is to not think of it as between , but as a set of exclusions step 1 , is the number less than 1711 \? if yes , then 7 , else go to step 2 step 2 , is the number less than 3331 \? if yes then 6 , else go to step 3 step 3 , 5 you see , you do n't need to worry about the number being less than 1711 in step 2 because in step 1 you already removed anything less than 1711 from your list , by multiplying it by 7 and ending your if statement i could also write the if statement the following ways if \( a1 3330 , a1 5 , if \( a1 1710 , a1 6 , a1 7 \) \) if \( a1 3330 , a1 5 , if \( a1 1711 , a1 7 , a1 6 \) \) if \( a1 3330 , if \( a1 1711 , a1 6 , a1 7 \) , a1 5 \) the latter was an attempt to check for your between first but if statements are not designed to worry about between , you use two ifs for that the trick is to remember that excel follows each if rule in order , so once it has done the first task , any number affected by that if statement is not available to the later if statements so if you have your first question be is a1 3330 then you no longer have to worry about your number being 3330 , because you already dealt with all those customers with your first if __eou__	Agent
PA	hi , try this 1 type 0 , 1711 and 3331 in range a2 a4 2 type 7 , 6 and 5 in range b2 b4 3 type 1500 in cell a6 4 in cell b6 , enter this formula vlookup \( a6 , a 2 b 4 , 2 , 1 \) a6 100 hope this helps __eou__	Agent

OQ	i want to create the effect of a slow drip using animation in powerpoint i need it to repeat until i advance to the next slide i have five droplets evenly spaced in a vertical line each fades in and then out , in order , making it look like the same drop is slowing moving down the line what i ca n't figure out is how to have that animation repeat until i click away from the slide the repeat function is only applied to individual animations , not to the entire set of animations as a whole how can i get the fade in fade out fade in fade out fade in fade out etc effect to continue repeating itself on a loop from the beginning \? counting on you geniuses to be way more clever than i am many thanks ! __eou__	User
PA	alexandria , do you need 5 drops , could you not use one drop with a motion path that repeats itself \? do n't know if you can do this on the mac though you could locate the drop outside the slide area and adjust the duration the path animation being repeated till the end of the slide excuse the poor representation of the slide something like this __eou__	Agent

PF	hi , molly , lucchristina 's suggestion definitely works , and it 's the parh i 'll take if the five drops idea proves impossible i'm still hoping that someone has a solution for the original challenge , as that would work best for the design of the slide what 's the etiquette here in terms of marking an issue resolved \? i havena functioning alternative thanks to lucchristina , but i 'd still prefer to find a way to implement the initial idea thanks for checking in ! __eou__	User
PA	the only way to do this as you want is to construct your own custom custom animation this is clearly not a trivial task if you download this demo i have created the five animations and you might be able to use the animation painter to apply each animation to the drops in turn the animation is specific to having exactly five drops ! do not try to change the timings __eou__	Agent

PA	hi there adam , the reason why the system is prompting you to confirm the year and the date of birth is , to confirm if the account owner is a minor or not microsoft has a strict policy with child accounts this is a security feature which parents can set up to protect and manage the account of their children if in case , you are stuck in a loop wherein you are being asked for your birth date , you can try changing your date of birth for your microsoft account you can refer to this support link for additional details if the steps above did not work for you feel free to post back if you need further assistance thanks __eou__	Agent
FQ	hey , danida i followed your instructions but it turns out that microsoft already has my year of birth registered as part of my microsoft online account and there is no way to get rid of the year the only thing that i can do is to change it to some other year in which i was not born , and i do n't see any point in doing that so , this begs the question given that microsoft already knows my full birthday , why is skype asking me for information that it clearly already has \? \? \? adam __eou__	User
PA	hi adam , i fully agree with your indignation in ms collecting dob of their users it is none of their business and in some country , you are not even allow to ask a job applicant the dob after all skype is a messenger , like whatsapp \( which has so far squash skype in popularity \) , signal , wire , and a host of messengers and none of the modern messengers use ancient concept of profile , may be skype wanting to become anther tinder the profile concept is ms' intention to harvest your online identity and to track your activities give them fake dob if ms insists on being so stupid and irrational i am wondering how much of the data in skype 's profiles are really genuine dumb action deserves dumb and fake info apart from calling landline , skype does not seem to have anything to offer but a great deal of hassle rover __eou__	Agent

OQ	hi everybody , i'm using ppv , and now i want to try ppc \( bing ads \) , my question is does bing allow direct linking \? thnaks __eou__	User
PA	hi , thank you for posting your query in microsoft community yes , bing allows direct linking and you link directly to the sales page from the bing ad here are the steps to start a direct linking campaign on bing 1 setup your first campaign first , open a bing or microsoft account then you can create your first campaign click on the campaigns tab and select create campaign then , name your campaign and set up the budget 2 create your ad next , you need to actually write your ad make sure you research your product well and pick the most appropriate keywords for your target market when you re done , enter the ad title , ad text , the display url and the destination url here s the difference between display url and destination url \? the display url is where you can add your main keyword to increase the click through rate and improve your results remember , although the display and destination url are used for different purpose , the domain name of the display url and destination url should always be the same if you re using more than one word in the display url , you can separate those either by an underscore or by hyphens 3 add your affiliate link now it s time to add your affiliate link in the destination url box however , you should never run affiliate campaigns without using some sort of tracking that can be used to track your results hope this information is helpful please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with windows in future __eou__	Agent

FD_PA	hello veronica84 , since skype is gradually rolling out this version of skype , you might bump into some issues once in a while this issue will help us improve user experience as a workaround , please try to uninstall and reinstall your skype application make sure to clear the data after uninstalling , and restart your device before reinstalling skype if the above information does not work , please do not hesitate to reply to this post thank you ! julie s1kiara skype community moderator __eou__	Agent

NF	i tried doing exactly what you said and it is still happening judging from the rest of the community your product is flawed and your new supposed update is a pile of rubbish kiara , i understand that you are not the issue here , i'm saying that the platform is failing , the decisions being made are not supporting the software and are driving people away from the microsoft product the decisions being made are impacting peoples bottom line and they will not stick around whilst other messaging and chat services are offering them a far better experience __eou__	User

CQ_IR_PA	when you say not referring to autosave i am not sure if you mean the auto recover or autobackup there is a description of autobackup at the following link \( go down towards the end of the page under heading autobackup \) https www online tech tips com ms office tips excel autorecover and automatic backup however , the above method overwrites the previous backups and if this is not what you require and you want to keep several versions of backups then you will need to change the document to a macro enabled workbook and use the save event vba code below to install the vba event code now when the workbook is saved , if changes have been made since opening , then a backup file will be created in the same folder as the master if no changes then the file will save as normal but no backup will be created the backup file name is in the format filename yyyy mm dd hh mm ss xlsm the reverse date with year first is used so the file names can be sorted all 2 digit months , days , hours , minutes and seconds are used because sorting is based on text and this ensures that sorting occurs correctly if the user selects save as then the backup code is not implemented and allows the user to create a file name of choice ie the user might select a backup version and the use save as to replace the master copy feel free to get back to me if any problems copy all of the code below into the vba editor private sub workbook beforesave \( byval saveasui as boolean , cancel as boolean \) dim strbackupname as string 'if user selects save as then the code for backup does not run so that user 'can select a backup and then save to whatever name is required if saveasui false then 'only run backup code if change made otherwise save simply saves without backup if activeworkbook saved false then on error goto reenableevents application enableevents false 'suppress recursive calls to save event thisworkbook save 'save normally 'create backup filename using date and time 'colons invalid in file name and hense colons replaced with spaces in time portion strbackupname left \( thisworkbook fullname , instrrev \( thisworkbook fullname , xlsm \) 1 \) format \( now , yyyy mm dd hh mm ss \) xlsm thisworkbook savecopyas filename strbackupname end if end if reenableevents if err number 0 then msgbox error occurred in thisworkbook module , private sub workbook beforesave end if application enableevents true end sub __eou__	Agent

FD_PA	when a page is still live on the web , the bing crawler \( bingbot \) will revisit it in regular intervals to update the content in our index and store a copy in the bing cache however , changes can take time to be reflected in the index and the cached page you can notify bing about outdated cache by providing the url and a piece of text from the outdated cached page that is no longer present on the page that is live on the web steps to submit an outdated cache removal request you can submit an outdated cache removal request for a page that is live on the web \( http status code 200 \) and for which we still have old and outdated content in our cache by doing the following __eou__	Agent

OQ	i have added quite a few sources to the bing news app the only way i can find stories from these sources is to click on each one however , this only shows me stories from the source i opened the top stories button only shows stories from sources that bing has chosen is there a way to get a top stories view that will show news articles from all the sources i added \? i'm looking for a view that 's similar to the way flipboard shows cover stories from every source you have added to the app thanks for any help ! __eou__	User

PA	this feature is currently not available you can click feedback and request the feature be added to bing news your feedback is important to us , and we are always looking for ways to improve the app here 's how you can contact us swipe in from the right edge of the screen or enter windows logo key c on the keyboard tap or click settings and select about tap or click feedback enter your feedback in the form , then tap or click submit note features might vary depending upon government policies , government restrictions or data services available in your area add an rss feed __eou__	Agent
PA	it appears as if you can delete \( remove \) all sources except featured story then , that and all of your personal added topics would be what 's left that 's about as close as it will let you get to your desired set up for now the featured story looks like eye candy and serves no real function other than that i too wish it could be removed , offering a clean slate to truly customize my news __eou__	Agent

FD_FQ_NF	hi , todd so good to hear from you again thanks for getting back to me i'm sorry i 've not been able to reply sooner i know how to use the menu in the way you 've shown , to select a certain size range overall for all the different images displayed what i'm talking about specifically is the ability to get multiple size choices for the same image , and it 's one of the image searching features that puts bing head and shoulders above google , imho i'm an almost daily contributor to fark com i search the internet for funny pictures in a variety of topics and post them there i prefer pictures in a sort of goldilocks range nothing that 's too big , and nothing that 's too small this is where this now broken feature comes in handy to illustrate further , and expand on the images i posted above , please compare this image with the first image i posted if you look carefully , you 'll notice that the underlined image size in the first image above is grayed out , while the one in this image is brighter , indicating an active link as i mentioned , if i time it right , i can click on that link if i do it within a second after refreshing the page , after which point the link grays out and goes dead that link leads to a page with multiple copies of the same image , all from different sources , with the larger sizes arrayed at the top of the page , ranging all the way down to the smaller sizes at the bottom of the page yeah , i can still access it , but i have to be quick and click on that link in the first second after refreshing the page , and it does n't always work this is not the way it is supposed to work , and not the way it has worked for as long as i 've been using bing additionally , the second picture i posted in my original post , there are three boxes marked large , medium and small , plus a fourth link that says search all sizes these links are still highlighted like the function , but they always lead to a dead page that says we did not find any results for , and these are pictures that always have other results no amount of quick fingered clicking will make these links function like they should this has been an incredibly useful feature to me , and it 's now broken it does n't work in firefox or internet explorer on my computer , and i checked a friend 's computer and it does n't work in ie or google chrome on theirs i think if you tried it on yours that you 'd find it does n't work like it 's supposed to in edge either this is a function i 've been using for quite a long time , and i can say without hesitation that it is broken , and the fault is with bing , not with my computer , as i 've checked another computer and got the same results __eou__	User
FD_PA	i experience the same results with size greying out once page loads 1 \) hover over the image of choice and click on the overlapping folders 2 \) you 'll be taken to main stream screen 3 \) scroll down and you 'll see size options when available 4 \) if sizes are not available , you will see this __eou__	Agent
FD	unfortunately , that does n't help yes , i can click on the overlapping folders , but clicking on any of the size icons or the search all sizes link still brings me back to this dead page the only workaround so far is to click as fast as possible on the image size link before it grays out and goes dead this is true for no matter what image i search , and has been happening for the last couple of weeks or so before that , everything worked just fine __eou__	User
PF	it 's now fixed ! i noticed earlier today \( sunday , may 1 \) that not only is the size link functioning as a link , but the icons at the bottom are all working as they should if you passed this on up the line , then i have you to thank for this ! __eou__	User

PA	hi stephen , were there any changes made on the computer prior to the issue \? the common two causes of this issue can be a microsoft account has not been verified yet on your computer b date and time in your computer is set wrongly method 1 the store app uses https instead of http which is used by other apps , so in order for the ssl handshake to proceed , the clock on the client and server needs to be correct follow the steps below to check if the date and time are set correctly a \) in the start screen type date and time , and click on date and time settings b \) check if the date and time is set correctly method 2 follow the steps below to finish 2 step verification process \( important \) a close the store app completely \( swipe down from the top \) b open the charms bar , click on settings and then on change pc settings c click on accounts , it will show your microsoft account there d see if there is a verify link below your account if so , click on it and go through the 2 step verification process e once done try starting the store and check if you are able to visit windows store method 3 you may try to reset the windows store cache let us know the results if you have any further issues on the computer , please post your question regarding windows and we will be happy to help you __eou__	Agent

CQ_IR_PA	hi pei , please let the report owner save the file as excel 97 2004 workbook \( xls \) and send it to you again , check if you can open it in excel for mac if the issue remains , please share the following information with us 1 your excel for mac version \( click excel about excel \) 2 screenshot of the message this page uses frames , but your browser does n't support them 3 does this issue occur to all excel files created in excel 2002 \? regards , george __eou__	Agent
FD_IR_PA	neither the creator version nor the file type is the issue the problem is that the file contains frames which are activex controls activex controls are not supported by excel online which the browser message suggests you 're actually trying to use or by any version of excel for mac it further sounds like the file may be stored on onedrive or other cloud service i do n't have any way to test , but unless there is other unsupported content i believe the online app should be able to open the file , but the unsupported content either will not be displayed or will not be usable if you download the file to your local hd you should be able to open it with the full desktop version of excel , but the activex controls still will not be functional verify that your installation of office is fully updated by going to excel about excel in the main menu bar of your locally installed software the current version is 15 38 or later if you continue to have a problem please include the version license information in your reply along with the exact wording \( or screen shots \) of any messages as well as any additional specific details you can supply __eou__	Agent

OQ	so for a few weeks now when i went in to view my bing search history on one of my accounts it displayed the results in textual format , line by line , with a timestamp \( hour and minute of the search \) of when the search was performed to the right this was different than the traditional way bing search history was previously showing which was a thumbnail image of the search grouped in rows columns with no timestamp other than just the day it was done now that account started showing the old way again , and i am not sure how to switch it back to the detailed search history with timestamps can anyone provide me with some guidance \? thanks __eou__	User
PA	hello , thank you for posting your query in microsoft community if i understand you correctly , you wish to switch back to the detailed search history with the timestamps in the first place , you may try to turn the bing search history off and then turn it back on check if this resolves the issue furthermore , you can set the internet explorer browser history with timestamps and check if that affects the bing search history refer to the following steps a open internet explorer b press ctrl h c search for a specific history entry by clicking the view by date box at the top of the history sidebar and clicking search history type a search query into the search for box and click search now __eou__	Agent
CQ_FD	thanks for the reply i know how to see the browser history and timestamps but i also log in at work and my browser at work is required to clear out history every day so i log in with my personal live account , and use bing to search for things this allows the searches to save to the https www bing com profile history page for a long time the bing history page showed the prior search history in three columns with square thumbnails of the page visited with the search term and site inside the square and no timestamp sometime in the last few weeks it started to show the history as a row , in text , with a timestamp to the right then as of yesterday , it started to show the three column square again i tried turning off the history in the page , and turning it back on , but it is still showing the old square thumbnail view is there a way to turn the other view back on \? hope that makes sense __eou__	User

FQ_RQ	how can i get excel to put any hours time after 7pm and until 5am to be inside the night column \? day c2 max \( min \( time \( 19 , 0 , 0 \) , b2 \) max \( time \( 5 , 0 , 0 \) , a2 \) , 0 \) night d2 max \( \( b2 a2 \) c2 , 0 \) this assumes that the start time will always be less than the end time and the elapsed time will be less than 24 hours you have described to separate situations in your description if you wanted to use 6 pm rather than 7 pm then just change time \( 19 , 0 , 0 \) to time \( 18 , 0 , 0 \) regards , jamie ogilvy __eou__	Agent
FD_PA	hi ! i solved the issue by somehow using tom 's formula however that failed at points when i had no daytime or when sometimes i had only night time so i got an average idea and made a working if statement formula along with another column with a set night time cut out i 'll post it below incase someone else ever needs something similar formula for day if \( l3 o 3 , if \( k3 o 3 , 0 , o 3 k3 \) , l3 k3 \) formula for night if \( l3 o 3 , if \( k3 o 3 , l3 k3 , l3 o 3 \) , 0 \) the second if statement inside the main if statement was added as when my time start was after 6pm , the formula returned negative values as it summed from 6pm an integer greater than 6 thus negative values the second if prevents that ! my new setup i have resolved this issue , this discussion may be closed ! thank you to all who helped __eou__	User

OQ	hello , the version of word that i am using is word 2013 i would really appreciate any help offered in putting a header in my word document this problem has been driving me spare because all i want to do is place a header on the first page only i enter the header i want on the first page and it immediately appears on every page thereafter then when i click the box which says different first page it simply deletes it from the first page but keeps it for every other page the exact opposite of what i want i 've then tried putting the heading i wanted back on the first page again and gone to the 2nd page before clicking different first page at first i thought i had cracked it because it vanished from the 2nd page and remained on the 1st , but then to my dismay i discovered that it was still there on every other page to me this is totally balmy ! surely there has to be a way of placing a header on the 1st page only if someone is able to point out to me why it 's me that is stupid and not the software then i will be most grateful __eou__	User
CQ_PA	this is controlled by sections if you put a section break at the end of the first page , you can then change the header with the second section also , if you use the different first page and it does what you describe , cut from the main header and paste into the first page header one last point , if you only want it to appear on the first page , why use a header at all \? why not just put it on the top of the text \? __eou__	Agent
FD_PF	thank you so much for this i 've got it sorted now as for creating a header in the first place i had a list split into columns at the bottom of the first page which i was trying to avoid getting split up and moving onto the second page , so i was trying to do that by creating more space at the top anyway i'm much the wiser now thank you again __eou__	User
PA	see the different first page setting in a one page document displays the first page header and hides the main header you can cut from the header you created , click on different first page , and paste there if you want do not create a different section to get different headers see also styleref field before you even think about doing this __eou__	Agent
PA	you should click the different first page button before you enter the information that you want in the first page header __eou__	Agent

OQ	hello , please forgive that i have asked this in another forum already , but i have received no responses there , and it has been out there for several weeks now my hope is that maybe someone in this forum possibly has some ideas \? i have been trying a few different things , and have done some research , but have n't yet found an answer to this question i have a total of 71 workbooks with 2 tabs each , and they all need to be set up for printing while i have set everything up for printing as best i could , some of them print out really small i 'll provide an example i 've set the page breaks manually for all of these one sheet tab has the following a1 i30 that needs to print as page 1 a31 f64 needs to print as page 2 a65 f88 needs to print as page 3 a89 h135 needs to print as page 4 a136 g167 needs to print as page 5 a168 j202 needs to print as page 6 a203 i239 needs to print as page 7 a240 g264 needs to print as page 8 now , that 's only one tab , and literally every tab has different ranges for each page the challenge is that when everything is adjusted to fit the largest area , the percentage shrinks for everything is there a way to make each manually created page on this one tab \( as described above \) print as a different percentage for each manually created page \? \( so that each range above prints at a different percentage \? \) so , for example \( and i'm using random percentages here for illustration purposes \) , if say the defined range that makes page 8 could print as 100 and fit on one page , but page 6 maybe needs to be 40 to fit on one page , and say page 2 could fit at 85 for one page , is this possible to accomplish \? note everything needs to remain on the one tab so , right now with those above ranges for this example , all pages print at 40 when not all pages otherwise would not need to print out that small the only reason all pages print out at 40 now is because of accomodating for the largest area \( manually created page \) \( note i have also tried setting print areas manually as well and that did n't seem to make a difference \) thanks in advance for any assistance you can provide __eou__	User
FD_IR	thank you very much for the code i put the code in , and re saved the document as an xlsm i did some test printing where i printed out the one with the code applied , and then printed the original xlsx version to compare them side by side unfortunately , there is no visible difference between the two the smaller areas that would otherwise fit on the page at 100 are still printing out really tiny leaving a lot of white space in addition to being hard to read due to the tiny printing i get the larger areas need to print smaller and have tiny print , but the goal is to print the smaller areas with larger print also , i have used code before , and have never seen the notice from excel that i saw with this code , and am curious as to why that may be there was a security warning privacy warning this document contains macros , activex controls , xml expansion pack information , or web components these may include personal information that cannot be removed by the document inspector these documents will be widely distributed to users who do not know how to use excel all that well and that warning going out with them is not something that would work well i did also reset all of the page breaks just to see if that would make a difference in allowing the code to sort of take over , and that did not work either i appreciate your assistance and effort __eou__	User
PA	if you ca n't manually adjust a section to fit on one page and be readable , then a macro wo n't be able to do it either if you can do it , then record the percentage and modify the macro to set the zoom to that percentage rather than use fit to page regards , trevor ogilvy __eou__	Agent

FD_FQ	thank you both very , very much for the different codes i have tried all of them as best i could i used all 4 codes with the original page breaks in place i used all 4 codes after re setting page breaks , and then setting print areas i used all 4 codes after re setting page breaks completely unfortunately , none of this worked with the last 2 codes , the array formula was red \( error \) with the two \( \( , so i removed one to make it \( , and the red line \( error \) went away i sincerely appreciate the efforts , and perhaps trevor ogilvy was correct with the first thought that this possibly cannot be done with a macro either we may just need to strongly encourage people to not print these out and view them electronically __eou__	User
PA	the code sets the print area in the command set r1 ws range \( a1 i30 , a31 f64 , a65 f88 , a89 h135 , a136 g167 , a168 j202 , a203 i239 , a240 g264 \) in the code i posted and in the command vrng array \( \( a1 i30 , a31 f64 , a65 f88 , a89 h 135 , a136 g167 , a168 j202 , a203 i239 , a240 g264 \) on the code tasosk posted \( and there is an extra left paren which you have correctly removed \) these will be the pages if the zoom settings are set to fit that area on a single page then each of the codes has the command printarea where it passes the address of the range for the specific area being printed you should remove all manual pagebreaks because scaling does not override pagebreaks like fit to page does to summarize no manual page breaks no printareas defined put percent scaling into the arrays to correspond to the range areas determined by doing it manually first \( but if you ca n't see the page data doing it manually , then using the same scaling with the code will be no better regards , trevor ogilvy __eou__	Agent

OQ_RQ	hi trevor i got to this post because i am trying to combine 2 tabs to print with different scaling what differs from the case above is that the range of data in the first tab varies according to different parameters \( via a macro \) so i cannot put in already a set zoom degree , because the range needs to be according to the populated rows of the tab \( which i guess i can do with some counta function \? \) but for sure the tab is well printable on a paper sheet \( zoom varies between 80 and 50 \) is this doable at all \? many thanks regards valeria __eou__	Agent

OQ	is there an article about the limitations in the document properties for sharepoint i'm in the progress to use a custom content type to add some document specific properties , but before doing that i would like to know the limitations from my short experiences there might be limitations in the number of characters in text strings i have not succeeded to edit the quickpart text using word online , get some complains of some add in but generally i'm interested in some reference documentation describing the limitations so i do n't jump into a implementation not feasible edit updated with a link to where the limitations are presented https technet microsoft com en us library cc262787 \( v office 16 \) aspx column __eou__	User
IR_PA	i do not have an answer but write to point out the distinction between document properties and document property content controls \( under quick parts \) these are related but different it is important that let us know which you are discussing repeating data using document property content controls and other mapped content controls the dp content controls are a limited list general document properties include most of those and more you can have custom document properties as well quickpart text is a building block gallery and only one of many __eou__	Agent
FD_PF	thanks alexis , this made me a bit more clever but what i'm looking for is the interconnection between an office document and a sharepoint document library what limitations are expected within this \? __eou__	User
PA	i guess i found what i'm looking for https technet microsoft com en us library cc262787 \( v office 16 \) aspx column __eou__	User
FQ	helpful link , thanks unfortunately i cannot give you the whole picture , or even anything like the whole picture , but some things to look out for a the sharepoint data types do not map all that well onto the word content control types \( there are a lot more of the former , for one thing \) b some of the mapping , in particular the presentation choices , used to be better when the old document information panel \( dip \) was available , in the sense that the display in the dip conformed better to the data type in sharepoint but i do not think for example you can present a multiple choice as a set of radio buttons in word c as far as i know , the current version of word online lets you see content controls \( and even the content control name tags \) but does not let you edit their contents i think you have to use an office \( javascript \) add in to do that however , even that may depend on whether you are using the public version of word online or one hosted by a private sharepoint site , although i assume that the latter version always catches up to the former d when you edit in desktop word , what word actually looks at to try to validate the data in a content control is the xml schema that is generated by sharepoint and inserted along with the server metadata but the user does not necessarily get to see that they have invalid data until they click outside the control or try to save but some of the constraints that you might think would be applied are not for example , if you specify a multiline type in sharepoint , you can specify a maximum line count , and afaik you do not get to specify a character count limit but when you enter a new line in a plain text content control in word , what word inserts is a hard line return , and the resulting lines do not appear to count as lines as far as sharepoint is concerned further , word seems to impose a 255 character maximum whatever sharepoint allows e because the word checkbox content control type was not one of the original types , sharepoint does not use it \( although i think perhaps it should , now \) so the obvious user interface element for yes no type values is not used instead , you get a dropdown that presents true and false choices , and theya re literally those choices because that 's what gets sent in the xml f as a general rule , indexed types are probably not going to work as you might like e g a lookup just presents a number , not the text actually referenced by the lookup and i do n't think stuff such as person group or managed metadata types will work properly edit at least some of the stuff that you used to be able to do in the dip you can now do in backstage in the property editing area in fact some of it is better in thte sense that you do get to see lookups etc from sharepoint __eou__	Agent
FQ	thanks mindy , looks like there 's a lot of stuff that does not work as expected do you know if this has been reported as faults to microsoft using a microsoft premier support agreement my experience is that once you reported the faults within a premier support agreement \( and push it to be a design fault \) you will get a change , even though it takes some time \( approximate 9 12 months \) __eou__	User
PA_PF	do you know if this has been reported as faults to microsoft using a microsoft premier support agreement no , i do n't although i sometimes report things through the mechanisms available to me , i'm not a company paying a lot for support , and my personal experience of almost all avenues to microsoft support was almost always very , very bad , so i try to spend as little time as possible interacting with any of them part of the problem is that when there is no response from them , you cannot even tell whether a problem has already been discovered or reported it wastes everyone 's time , not just theirs i generally only report stuff that appears to have changed accidentally or which looks to me as if it is not going to require a major effort to be honest it would surprise me if such the various shortcomings to do with controls sharepoint had not been reported by people who use that stuff day in , day out there certainly seems to have been an outcry when infopath was deprecated some of the problems might be perceived as design faults , but i think in many cases it is probably more to do with the fact that the word team introduced content controls at a certain point in sharepoint 's development and there has been some ossification otoh if you have a good experience of microsoft support , it may be worth your while reporting stuff that you come across that does n't work as you might expect ! __eou__	Agent

PA	windows rt runs on a different processor type from normal windows programs written for normal windows wo n't run on rt i have seen no reports that the malware writers have bothered to re write their payload to run on rt rt has such a small userbase that i doubt they ever will if you are keeping your machine updated using windows update then you should have any necessary patches __eou__	Agent
PF	thank you kari2 for sharing your impression of the situation we are looking for reliable , official statements as far as i understood , wannacry is using eternalblue , a smb protocol vulnerability , so winrt would be affected , too in a msrc team statement regarding wannacrypt i found the ms security bulletin for the patch so windows rt 8 1 seems to have been granted a patch in dec 2016 __eou__	Agent
FD_PA	indeed muc , ms patched the smb protocol however , the vulnerability is the means of getting the attack payload onto the machine it then has to run on the machine to encrypt the files if it is n't written to run on arm processors then it cannot run and will not encrypt the files nowhere have i seen any talk of it encrypting files on rt systems because the payload wo n't run on rt the msrc statement does n't mention windows rt as to official statements on here this is a site where most of the responders are volunteers who do n't work for ms you will rarely find ms developers on here __eou__	Agent
OQ_RQ	one of the two correspondents above , randy , pointed me at microsoft 's technet page on the smb bug and patch this makes it clear that the patch was prepared for w8 1 rt and that all subscribers to windows update should therefore have received it this assurance is repeated in this microsoft blog article which also reaffirms that the vulnerability was remediated and the patch distributed in march these are clearly official statements and i thank the two correspondents for helping me get to here does anyone know how this would appear in the update log and how to parse it \? the windows 8 1 update browser does n't seem to mention either the kb 4013389 reference nor the patch reference ms17 010 , is there another one available maybe via the desktop daveangela __eou__	User

PA	hello , i think windows defender does a decent job in protecting you computer from the most prevalent and widespread threats combined with windows firewall , you also get a protection from online unauthorized access to you computer and lan protection from local networks attacks \( like in open wifi zones \) however , windows defender scores low in many av tests given that these tests really use very sophisticated malware that are zero day malware \( windows defender scores very low in this category \) normal users do not typically encounter those creepy malware also , windows defender does not provide strong protection against ongoing exploits \( some other security products can detect exploit activity on vulnerable apps and prevent it \) , so make sure you keep all you software updated , especially windows , as microsoft continuously provide new updates to secure you system now , you are the one to decide if you need an additional security software or not i just can give you some points to consider while deciding 1 are you a cautious user \? this mean , for example , do you easily recognize suspicious websites or downloads or not or can you spot signs of infection \? 2 how often do you shop online using your banking information \? 3 do you have very important data in your computer \( this may sound silly \) \) \? 4 do you install infamous software often \? 5 do you mind running malwarebytes scans weekly \? 6 etc just understand that if you want premium protection , windows defender is far from being the best product , however , it provides decent protection against the most common threats advanced security products often offer advanced cloud protection , very impressive detection of zero day malware \( very recent unknown threats \) , automatic prevention from exploits , protection from fishing websites \( higher than the smart screen filter \) you choose , i think you are the only one to know if you need high protection or only a basic one i used windows defender in windows 8 windows 8 1 for quite some time and it did a great job protecting my system until once i realized i had a rootkit that it did not detect i am now using another security suit i hope this helps __eou__	Agent

FD_OQ	it 's all in the title when bing news makes an announcement on my computer why does it repeat this announcement 4 or 5 times \? how can i get it just to make 1 announcement \? regards __eou__	User
PA	i would first advise you to clear your browser 's cache of temporary internet files and cookies each of the three major browsers \( chrome , firefox and internet explorer \) starts this procedure with ctrl shift delete and then there may be some options you wish to engage that will be individual to the browser in question one of these will be to clear the cookies and you will need to turn that on a word of caution when clearing your cookies you may also clear log ion information to some sites you visit requiring usernames and passwords make sure that you know your usernames and passwords for each of these sites before you clear your cookies as you may be asked to reenter the information on a subsequent visit so my first advise would be to clear the cache and cookies and restart the browser if this does not resolve your announcement acknowledgement problem , post back with any updates and we can see if there are further avenues to pursue __eou__	Agent

FD_NF	hi julie and thanks for finally getting back to me amazing that microsoft shoots itself in the foot by making it so much less attractive to bother giving customers what they want and need i now have no reason to use skype number vs google number and i am now totally unhappy that i even paid for it maybe this is one to bump up the chain to microsoft 1 the reason to get a skype number \( and same reason people get a google number \) is to have a voip replacement for a landline one that potentially small consulting businesses like me might want to use as a face to clients however , clients and in fact people , do n't like to be reminded they are reaching a voip generic number when you take the ability to personalize away , you defeat the purpose for some of us google knows this , why do n't you \? 2 microsoft 's customer service has frankly always been terrible and it seems to somehow be getting worse and worse skype has fallen down in it 's ability to be what it used to be and partly for these two reasons the fact that it can take weeks to get help or a response is appalling frankly these days i look at microsoft and scratch my head wondering why you drive away customers by making it so difficult for them to love your services is microsoft now only about selling volume in foreign countries and does n't care at all about service \? as someone who 's been in the tech industry for many years , watched the rise and now what looks like the fall that could be another rise if this attitude were fixed , i see so many opportunities missed by the company on all fronts why has google risen and outstripped you \? giving the user what they want and need and with good service why have companies like amazon won the market \? customer service and giving customers what they want and need with ease looking down the line at services that are now filling the gap you have sitting right in the palm of your corporate hand you will lose more and more of this market share unless you start paying attention in taking away something as simple as the ability to have a personalized message to whoever calls me replaced my some generic message that makes people hang up let 's just say you are alienating customers i will now stop paying you for what i can not use a shame really a shame please do bump that up the chain it 'll probably go nowhere and fall on deaf ears , but frankly i am now going back to not using microsoft products the way i was __eou__	User

IR_OQ	i paste a lot of text from other docs , and the web into my ppt i want to be able to quickly do this with a keyboard shortcut i 've added paste special to my toolbar , but i have to select it with my mousepad and then choose formatted or unformatted again with the mousepad i 've customized a lot of shortcuts like this in excel , but do n't see that as an option in ppt is there way to do this in ppt \? __eou__	User
PA	sorry , but custom keyboard shortcuts are n't possible in ppt unfortunately , the nature of the command prevents it from being assigned by way of os x keyboard shortcut methods as well i understand that it might be doable using apple script or vba triggered by a keystroke but have never tried it depending on the source you may be able to right click a blank spot on a slide \( not in a text box or placeholder \) then more expeditiously use paste special unformatted text from the shortcut menu __eou__	Agent
GG	alright , thx again kimberly bummer about this __eou__	User
PA	this because it is 2017 and microsoft is so totally innovative they ca n't even implement easy pasting of text into their yearly updates of office because basic functionality is apparently not an important feature the only workaround i have found is to put the paste keep text only tab into your quick access toolbar then you can access it via atl whatever number it is in the toolbar to add commands to the qa toolbar now hit alt \( or the mac equivalent \) and see which number has been assigned to your new command on mine it is 7 , so alt 7 will insert text w o formatting now give thanks to microsoft for the hour you just wasted to implement a remedially normal functionality that already exists in all other modern software by just hitting ctrl shift v thanks ms ! __eou__	Agent
PA	hi , i was just struggling with the same thing and this is what i 've settled on create a keyboard shortcut just for the powerpoint app using the osx system preferences \( as described here in step 5 https computers tutsplus com tutorials how to set up custom keyboard shortcuts on your mac mac 176 \) type in 'paste special ' without the quotations i have put in shift alt cmd v this shortcut will then bring up the paste special options within powerpoint in the middle of the screen , and you just hit the down arrow twice to get 'unformatted text' , then return to select it so effectively it is a keyboard shortcut just a longer one ! shift alt cmd v down arrow down arrow return but it 's quick once you get used to it , and mouse free __eou__	Agent

FD	i'm trying to initiate a group call mac version seems to allow you to create a list which i will use on a weekly basis to initiate a call to that list but i ca n't find anyway to simply contact that list in a group call it seems like i need to go go file , click on new conversation , then add all individuals one by one to this new conversation very cumbersome anyone know how to simply contact everyone in a list simultaneously \? 2nd question can someone who i did n't call initially still call into me and be added to our group conversation in process \? do i have to find some kind of share screen button to add them , or are they automatically added to the ongoing call if they call me , and i accept \? thanks so much ! ! ! dre __eou__	User
PA	hi dre , creating a list on skype is only to organize the contacts and only contacts within that list will be displayed you will still need to highlight all of the contacts you want to have a group video voice call and then right click then click call to start a group call or you can just create a group chat on skype so you can just simply click the video icon for group video calling also , if someone calls you while you re on a group video voice call , you will have an option to add them to your ongoing group call you 'll see an incoming call notification screen , click the add incoming call button hope this information helps feel free to reply for other concerns thanks __eou__	Agent

RQ	thanks very much for taking the time to respond we 're running a weekly meeting where people might join in while it 's in progress i guess you are saying that if they try to call in , there 's no function that allows me to add them to the existing call \? so i need to not take the call , but call them back through the add to call function which i do have \? \? seems a bit cumbersome if this is true , but workable joshua __eou__	User

OQ	i am running windows 8 1 and went to back up my data on my toshiba 1tb external hard drive but i am being asked for a bitlocker password that i do not remember doing i have tried all the possible passwords that i might have used but with no effect i have a load of important information on this drive and it is driving me mad any ideas on how to remove this password \? \? \? \? \? original title bitlocker password __eou__	User
PA	hi , thank you for contacting microsoft community i understand your concern and would like to inform you that to unlock your drive , you will need either the bitlocker password or the bitlocker recovery key while enabling bitlocker , you get the option to create a password key and a recovery file if you had saved the recovery file somewhere , you can still decrypt but i am really sorry to say that if you do not remember any of these , then we ll be not be able to help you further due to security reasons you may go through the following microsoft article to get more information http windows microsoft com en us windows 8 unlock bitlocker protected drive http windows microsoft com en us windows 8 bitlocker drive encryption see also https technet microsoft com en us library hh831507 aspx bkmk bltgunlock write to us if you need assistance with windows in future we ll be glad to help __eou__	Agent
PA	attempt to find the bitlocker recovery key if you printed it out , look through your personal paperwork if you saved it on a computer or another drive , do a search for files with bitlocker in the name if you think you might have written the password down then you can look for that too if you are unable to find the recovery key then you have two remaining options one is to try and crack the bitlocker password if you did things properly this wo n't work the whole point of bitlocker is it ca n't be cracked but if you used a weak password it might it 's not a topic i know about in detail and it probably should n't be discussed on microsoft answers anyway the second is to run a data recovery tool on any other computers or drives you have , and hope that you or your programs saved copies of the files on there in the past photorec is my usual choice , http www cgsecurity org wiki photorec to use it you will need another external drive with lots of free space this might be your best chance of getting some of your files back , __eou__	Agent

CQ_FQ	how would i reinstall it it came on the computer please help thanks \) __eou__	User
FD_PA	you reinstall as per the instructions given by your laptop maker , which usually requires you to create the recovery disks from the hidden recovery partition , when you first got the pc of course by installing win7 you have probably destroyed the recovery partition , and as such you will need to contact the pc makers support to request the recovery disks , for which there is likely to be a charge __eou__	Agent

FD_PA	hi michael , please try clicking insert menu header and footer , in the slide tab , you can choose to apply to one slide or apply to all in the notes handouts tab , you can apply to all regards , joannejanet __eou__	Agent
FD	many thanks for responding , janet i have been able to update headers and footers using the window you showed above i'm afraid i was n't very clear about what i'm trying to do i'm trying to apply changes i made to the notes master \( font , font size , position of the slide , size of the notes text box \) i have looked everywhere for the command to do this while on the notes page a tedious workaround \( i am working with a slide library of 3500 slides \) copy the notes from the notes page delete the notes placeholder on that page go to the normal view and paste keep text only in the notes portion below the slide go back to notes page to make sure it worked i fear some of the problems have resulted from many slide layouts and template changes , many slides copied and pasted among presentations and switching between powerpoint and keynote and back again i'm sure the presentations were created with many versions of both powerpoint and keynote i was hoping the notes master had improved since office 365 2016 was release that said , thank you microsoft for allowing multiple pages of notes to print ! yay that 's a great improvement that i did n't know about __eou__	User
FD_NF	there is an earlier post where steve posted some code update i tried it on a mac and it failed __eou__	Agent
CQ	hi michael , thanks for your clarification generally , if we make changes to notes master , the format of the slides should be the same as the slide master when we view slides in notes page i would like to confirm are you changing the notes master in view tab notes master \? if so , please try creating a new presentation and changing its notes master , then click view menu on the top menu bar and select notes page to check whether the changed notes master is applied meanwhile , you can try updating your office to the latest version to check the result if the above is not your case , feel free to post back with details \( some related screenshots and so on \) to clarify your situation please share with us your powerpoint version in powerpoint menu about powerpoint as well regards , joannejanet __eou__	Agent
FD	i think you will find janet that if you alter the notes page \( eg move the text box or change font \) then generally , if we make changes to notes master , the format of the slides should be the same as the slide master when we view slides in notes page is not true i have n't tried steve 's code but i do n't think it can be reapplied from the gui __eou__	Agent
FD	janet , yes , i am changing the notes master in view tab notes master i am on office 365 and should have the most recent version i do n't have any pending updates version 15 37 is what the about box shows my guess is that there are some slides that were pasted in from various presentations and some how they kept their original formatting and wo n't change when notes master is changed some slides do seem to update to the new format while others do n't i have found some slides with multiple text boxes \( on top of one another \) so the bottom one \( which is n't visible \) is updated with some stray box on top of it in the old format another oddity is that some slides \( possibly originally created in keynote \) let me change the font but wo n't let me change formatting \( bold , italic \) really weird i am plowing through this with my workaround but it would be swell if there was easy access to an apply notes master command on every page like there used to be \( i think it was a right click to the list of commands \) the only reliable way to change the notes formatting themselves is to cut the text , delete the text box , and go to normal view and paste text only which recreates the text box with the current notes master formatting but this wo n't change the placement of the slide \( which i have occasionally had to move or make smaller \) sometimes the only work around to fix that is to create a new slide , copy the slide elements to it and copy the notes thanks for anything you might be able to do to help in the future i have a deadline so unfortunately , i have to muscle through this manually right now __eou__	User
FD_PA	hi michael , thanks for your clarification regarding there are many slides that were pasted from various presentations , which have multiple formats , slide and text box placement , it is not feasible to re apply all the format , placement in notes master to a slide or all slides at once you may check whether johnbrian 's suggestion helps based on my research and test , the macro johnbrian provided in this thread will reset the text box 's placement to be the same as the notes master for all slides at once , you may check if it helps meanwhile , we understand the inconvenience and i can feel your frustration , we invite you submit your feedback in our powerpoint uservoice by voting for that idea and creating comments it is the best way to let related team understand users' requirement , and help improve our products for you and others we appreciate your understanding __eou__	Agent

PA	hi carlin , it is not feasible to export a powerpoint presentation based on a custom slide show in office 2016 for mac on mac , i do not have any suggestions , but i 'd like to explain that it is possible to do this on the windows version of powerpoint 2016 so if you also have a windows machine , you can do it there instead additionally , given the situation , we suggest you submit your idea via uservoice this is the best way to make our products and services better for you and others regards , emily updated by sheenemily v ali msft , 25 july 2017 , 1 55 am \( utc \) __eou__	Agent
PA	it sounds like you 're using either the file save as or the file export method to create the pdfs you 're correct that the method offers no option other than including all slides in the presentation they 're designed to output the entire file to make a pdf of a specific custom show or to use other specific settings , such as individual ranges of slides use the file print method instead the print dialog includes a custom shows dropdown which allows the choice of which custom show to print , then use the pdf button in the lower left corner of the dialog select save as pdf __eou__	Agent

OQ	hi skype , my iphone automatically updated my \( wonderful \) old version 6 1 210 of skype to the new \( terrible \) skype 30 minutes of wasted effort trying to work out how to use it i gave up and used my os x desktop app luckily i had not updated my itunes app library so deleted the new version of skype and reloaded the one i loved best back onto my phone that 's when my login in problems started i have reset my password on the phone and have been able to log in using my macbook pro with it but it refuses to let me log in with my iphone when resetting the password via the phone it told me i needed to set up a microsoft account which i did not want but did it anyway in the vague hope that it would let me log in sadly that did not work either so at present my phone says unable to connect to skype and the only place i can log into skype is via my desktop so to recap things i have tried but have not worked i have checked my iphone , computer and router network settings and can surf the web on my iphone via wifi or 4g i have reset the skype password and created a microsoft account but that does not help logging in on the phone i have turned off the phone and on again went through the phone recover details process whereby it tells me i have one skype account but refuses to let me sign in things i will not do use the new ios version of skype continue to have a microsoft account as i do n't want it or need it i hope you can help me log in with my old version 6 1 210 please \? __eou__	User
PA	hello monica , welcome to the skype community forum ! unfortunately , there is no option to downgrade to the older version as it is already unsupported it will still ask you to update your skype version should you have further queries , please do not hesitate to reply to this post thank you __eou__	Agent
CQ	i understand that the older version is no longer supported but that does not explain why i cannot use it to log in it ran , runs and works on my iphone , except for trying to log in to your system has someone written some code to prevent the older version from being able to be log in \? it was working until my iphone accidentally automatically updated the old version very recently there is no reason why the old \( much better \) version cannot log in unless microsoft skype are forcing people to use the new inferior one by actively denying their right to access the service using the older software they like and are much more familiar with if they do not want to upgrade __eou__	User
FD_PA	hello monica , thank you for your response unfortunately , the old version has already been retired with this being said , there is no option anymore to revert back or sign in to the older version please understand that it is sometimes necessary to discontinue older versions to make way for improved versions and provide our customers with better user experience should you have further queries , please do not hesitate to reply to this post thank you __eou__	Agent
FD_FQ_NF	well hello joseph a , i relise you do not offer the chance to redownload the old version , i had it as a back up i reinstalled the back up older version , which works on my phone the login is the issue , something which you and your colleagues are suggesting skype microsoft have made sure people will have to upgrade in order to be able to log in this is blackmail i would like a refund of my existing credit as i wish to move to a different platform __eou__	User

FD_FQ_NF	from what i have read as there were automatic updates longer than 14 days ago my money is stuck in the skype credit system can you confirm this please \? also 1 is there anyway to refund my skype credit and can you explain exactly how i can do this \? 2 if there is no way to refund my skype credit where will this credit go if i never use it \? 3 can you confirm who the skype credit belongs to please \? 4 if the skype credit belongs to me then can i have it back \? 5 if the skype credit belongs to me but skype are unable to refund my skype credit can you confirm that skype is refusing to refund my skype credit \? 6 if skype change a product which a user purchased said product does not like does the user have any rights to keep using the original program they preferred before skype microsoft \( july 1st \) forced people to use the new version and not allowing them to revert back to a better previous version \? 7 if skype microsoft are refusing to let users log in as they a forcing people to upgrade to the new version is this not seen as a breach of contract from it 's original form \? look forward to hearing your reply to me this all seems a very deliberate action on part of skype microsoft to make a product so user unfreindly to force them to use another more favourable microsoft product instead just a guess a final question how many 4 5 stars and or good feedback have skype microsoft gained \( in a percentage term high number being good \) since they implemented their new version on the apple app store \? i'm betting it 's less than 2 __eou__	User

FD_PA	hi , event logs are special files that record significant events on your computer , such as when a user logs on to the computer or when a program encounters an error whenever these types of events occur , windows records the event in an event log that you can read by using event viewer advanced users might find the details in event logs helpful when troubleshooting problems with windows and other programs event viewer tracks information in several different logs windows logs include applications and services logs vary they include separate logs about the programs that run on your computer , as well as more detailed logs that pertain to specific windows services hope this information is helpful open event viewer by right clicking the start button , clicking control panel , clicking administrative tools , and then double clicking event viewer if you 're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation , type the password or provide confirmation click an event log in the left pane double click an event to view the details of the event __eou__	Agent

IR_PA	hi , there are several reasons why you are unable to launch the game bar on windows 10 it is possible that you do n't have the latest xbox app version installed on your computer or your pc does not meet the system requirements needed by the app to better assist you with your concern , please clarify the following information you may also refer to hardware requirements for game dvr on windows 10 to check the system requirements needed by the app __eou__	Agent
FD_FQ_NF	as mentioned in the op i'm on a desktop pc \( win os on ssd , i7 4790 , r9 390 , 32 gb ddr3 \) this is a very capable gaming rig , and easily exceeds the sys requirements no i never tried previously to launch the game bar this is the first time i 've tried and i have n't been able to get it to launch changes to windows 10 \? none other than the usual updates i just tried this now i was able to uninstall and reinstall the xbox app when i went to try and launch the game bar it flashed on the screen for about a second and then was gone only way to get it back was to again uninstall and reinstall the xbox app i was able to then launch the game bar and this time it stayed open but if i then go to launch the game it disappears i 've discovered that if i toggle the slider from off to on in settings gaming game bar i can get it back but it 's acting really weird accessing the game bar menu locks up the screen and i have to restart explorer to get everything back so i 've got it to show but i'm still completely unsuccessful actually getting it to now work with a game if i have to toggle the slider in settings gaming game bar to get it to work , then the game minimizes then when i click to relaunch the game neither win g or ctrl shift g works to launch game bar because the settings menu is then not the active window so i'm stuck in that fail loop clicking the game maximizes the game , but no game bar clicking settings to toggle the slider allows me to show the game bar but the game is n't maximized to allow the game bar to recognize it i click the game bar menu settings and it then locks up the screen so there 's no way to activate both at the same time i either have an active game bar and no game , or an active game and no game bar so it actually shows up now but is definitely not working properly __eou__	User
PA	thank you for your response for pc games in full screen mode , you won t see the game bar , but you can use the windows logo key alt r to start and stop recordings you ll see the screen flash when the recording starts and completes you can also use the windows logo key alt g to record the last 30 seconds if you ve already turned on background recording if the shortcuts do not work for a full screen game , press win g you ll see the screen flash twice confirming that the game is recognized after this , you can then run the game in full screen again and use the windows logo key alt r and windows logo key alt g if the issue persists , we suggest that you check for new windows updates and install the critical and important updates on your computer by following the steps on this link if your customized shortcuts are not working , you may also check for updates for apps and games from windows store by following the steps on this link should you need further assistance , you can reply to this post anytime __eou__	Agent
FQ	thanks michael , part of my problem with this was just not understanding how it 's supposed to show up when it 's working now that i understand that better , i can see that it works , but only if i use the method i mentioned to reset it for each instance of use that is to toggle the slider from on to off to on again in win 10 pc settings gaming game bar that seems to be the only way i can get it to work whether that 's intended function or not it works and i can live with that for now i 'd go to a third party app b4 spending any more time on this the other part is that when accessing the game bar menu i can make changes , but for some reason it still locks up the screen and i have to restart explorer to get everything on my desktop back but when i reopen game bar the changes have been saved so it is technically working , but with the explorer restart glitch so 50 success with this but i do n't want to waste any more time on this i will revisit this after windows 10 's next major update where i 'll choose to reinstall the os , rather than slipstream the updates __eou__	User

OQ	hi , to make sure you understand what i mean because the writings have been going on in parallel and over a long period of time they have not always followed the same rules now that i am approaching the final phase , it is important that i put them all under same rules 1 \) how do i make my style ribbon the same , by which i mean , how do i display in the ribbon , all the styles i use sorted the same way in all three tomes \? or if it is easier , how can i transfer the ribbon from one of my tomes to the two other tomes \? 2 \) although the page sizes are the same , sections do not always have the same margins how can i change all of them at once in one tome \? as always , most grateful serge __eou__	User
PA	i think that what i would do is if you used styles with the same name in each the documents for the same purposes , those style should be adopted in each of the documents if you want each of the documents to have the same margins , you will need to change them manually , or , if you are combining the documents and each of the documents contain only a single section , if you copy everything except for the final paragraph mark in a document and then paste it into one of the other documents , the margins for the pasted text should conform to those of the document into which it was pasted __eou__	Agent

FD_NF	hi ron , thanks for the reply , and great suggestion ! it didnt work though \( i loaded up word in safe mode and created the table in a new document as per my last test as you can see the text is displayed correctly before i split the right column when i split the 4th row the text disappears from column 1 3 and i am unable to select the cells in row 2 , column 1 3 i have no loaded addons either this issue doesnt exist in word 2013 , it works perfectly there cheers , michael __eou__	User
FD_PA	sorry , i am at a loss your problems are definitely not the way word is supposed to work normally , this sort of strange problem is caused by problems with addins from here the normal trouble shooting process is do an office repair , uninstall office from control panel programs and features , uninstall office using fix it tool you test to see if problem is fixed between steps the first step just refreshes your program code there should be no impact on your setup the second step re installs office while keeping all of your current customizations , macros etc again , no impact the third step also wipes out all of your customizations and re installs sometimes problems are located in the customizations good luck __eou__	Agent
RQ	hi i wonder if this same issue of disappearing text also happens when you instead merge cells \? i am having the exact same problem as text in my merged cells disappears see link to my question https answers microsoft com en us msoffice forum msoffice word mso win10 mso 2016 text disappearing from merged cells in table using d5a8e1ff 8215 49d5 950f c02657bef0b6 i think there has got to be a recent update that is making the text disappear i have tried repairing office , but no change also waiting for help ! __eou__	Agent
PA	hi ritahfun , i think our problems are the same , and has nothing to do with merged cells if a column is split into another row , the text in the other columns will disappear , which looks like from your screenshots is happening to you as well my best guess is this was caused by a recent windows update __eou__	User

PA	hi tiffany , we apologize for the inconvenience since skype is under the umbrella of microsoft , we have completely migrated and adopted microsoft s terms and condition with that , you are being asked for a parental permission is because the system detected that your age on file is under 13 years of age that s why it was categorized as a child account but you don t have to worry about this one because we can change the date of birth on your account , so you can have the correct age on file and for us to do it , we strongly recommend several options that you can choose on with that , i will be sending you a message and kindly check your email for the details thank you ! marites p skype community moderator __eou__	Agent

OQ	i'm using powerpoint for mac 15 36 and would like to edit a narration that i 've made on a slide without having to re record the whole narration is that possible \? thanks ! __eou__	User
PA_PF	hi jill45 , for how to edit a narration that you have made on a slide without having to re record the whole narration , here are two methods you may try 1 if you linked your sound files when you recorded the narration then each of them is a separate file on the hard drive , probably in the same folder as your ppt work out which file goes with which slide , record a new narration using once you have a sound file you like , save it to the same filename as the original sound file for that slide and you 're good to go irrelevant and inaccurate suggestion removed here thanks , cherry __eou__	Agent
PA_PF	i 've edited cherry 's reply to remove a second suggestion that has n't been valid since mac office 2011 was released , and possibly longer than that if the audio files are not linked , you can change the pptx file extension to zip , open the zip file in any of a number of tools , browse to the media folder within the zip , locate the audio file that corresponds to the slide you want to edit , then extract and edit the audio file add the edited file back in \( must have the same name and be added back to the same folder in the zip \) then rename the zip back to pptx __eou__	Agent

OQ	i 've run into an interesting problem with a windows 8 1 machine that recently crashed during a routine windows update cycle system crashed on restart , and all you get is the blinking cursor screen as if no bootable drive is present i can boot into repair disk to see the windows 8 1 installation , but it now shows that windows is on drive g and c has been changed to the system reserved partition i 've tried every combination of fixing mbr via command line and even rebuildbcd i'm thinking windows is n't corrupted at all , and my only issue is the boot loader being incorrect if you look at bcdedit you can see that the active partition on boot manager thinks that it still should be c , but windows boot loader shows the os installed on drive g how can i revert back to having the install partition back on drive c like normal \? thanks ! __eou__	User
FD_PF	i was able to fix it ! here 's what i did for anyone else who might have this problem if any others are having trouble with this , just follow the steps like above and it should work i know there will be some who advise against changing the active partition , if you have a system reserved in my case this was the main reason why i could n't boot into windows so if all else fails , try the aboe to see if it works __eou__	User

PA	hi sonya , a if you sign in to the same account logged in to the old skype application , your skype contacts should appear on the windows 10 skype application to sign out on skype for windows 10 a this mainly depends on what device and skype platform you are using skype no longer supports the following platforms so as long your device is not included in the list above and meets the system requirements for you to run skype , then it would still be available for use thanks ! __eou__	Agent

OQ	previous versions of powerpoint had a button option to increase paragraph spacing or decrease paragraph spacing it seems now i have to enter the paragraph menu group , select line spacing options then adjust before or after this seems like a lot more work than clicking a button , that would show you real time adjustments my question is there someway to restore this function , or a hidden menu item that i am not finding \? __eou__	User
NF	unfortunately , no what you 've seen is what we 've been given or a manifestation of what 's been taken away __eou__	Agent
FD	i figured as much , but could n't find much outrage about it in my searches , so i figured either i was missing its new location or i may be one of the rare people that used the feature and now miss it i guess the latter is probably more true now __eou__	User
FD_PA	oh , there are plenty of other folks who feel the same as you do count me in in fact , i had to rewrite my earlier reply a few times to remove the unpleasant things i 'd written about the people who thought this misfeature up please visit the existing thread about this on uservoice and add your vote and comment to the discussion it 's here and the ppt developers really do read this stuff __eou__	Agent
FD_PA	just some thoughts \) despite the convenience of the increase decrease paragraph spacing buttons available in prior versions they did have limitations in view of the fact that they are gone may not return , you might find it more expedient to use the built in keyboard shortcut option command m which directly opens the paragraph formatting dialog as you probably know , you then can set both before after much more precisely \( 01 pt increments \) __eou__	Agent
FD	thanks for the short cut , it will save a few button clicks i agree it had limitations , but for 90 of what i do it sure was convenient and fast in most cases i prefer the fast option verses the fine control in powerpoint now if we are talking about page layout and graphic design i see the increase decrease paragraph spacing buttons as less useful i question if people were demanding and even need 01 pt increments for line spacing in creating powerpoint presentations then again i will readily admit i use only the basic features and it suits my needs thanks again for the reply __eou__	User

PA	consider setting up a different user account on the computer if you commonly allow others to use it a completely separate user account takes only seconds to switch over to and your own desktop and work can remain static in the background modern social media takes the unwarranted position that everyone wants them to have every personal detail of their lives and they attempt to conjoin onto every process they can set up a new user account and let others deal with the parasitic 'couplings' or simply tell them to get their own computer __eou__	Agent

OQ	hi i am trying to format an excel so that when i export reports it 'll automatically turn the percentages into whole numbers for example , when i try to change 100 into a number , it automatically changes it to 1 , not 100 the process i am currently using is very tedious , so i am hoping there is a simple solution __eou__	User
PA	put 100 in a cell select that cell and do a copy select all of the cells with the percentages and do a paste special and select values , formats and multiply then click ok this should convert your percentages to numbers now if you had a percentage that was 33 and it actually contained 33333333 then this would not make that a whole number however , you could format the cell to not show any decimal places after you multiplied by 100 you might want to test this process on a copy of your workbook until you are satisfied it does what you need regards , __eou__	Agent
CQ_FD	i put 100 in a cell and copied it but its unclear where i should put that copied 100 after that i selected all of my percentages and found the paste special values , but i'm confused about what the formats and multiply refer to and where i can find those for your example with the 33 , this is one of my big issues what i have been doing is multiplying all of my s by 100 in another column , then copying those values and pasting them as numbers i feel like what you explained is basically the same thing \? i was hoping there may be an easier way either way thank you for your help ! __eou__	User
PA	when you copy the 100 , then you select the destination cell and do the paste special in the dialog , you select three buttons values , formats multiply \( the multiply is in the operation section \) this will multiply the cells in place by 100 and it will reformat the cell so you do n't get was 33 after 3300 \( by not pasting formats \) but instead will get 33 of course this assumes that you formatted the cell with the original 100 with the format that you want to see after the paste yes it is the same thing as you do with your formula , but you do n't have to created the formulas , and copy and paste all the cells , then remove the formulas it can be used on non contiguous ranges and so forth it is a technique i use all the time with little thought or effort it takes seconds to perform of course you could use a macro but beyond that , i ca n't think of a built in method that is easier perhaps someone else will have a better idea regards , eric ogilvy __eou__	Agent

PA	yes i recommend the 2 separate backups approach a full image copy backup , either using the win 7 backup or macrium this is to primarily capture your os , but it can also capture your personal data files personally i prefer macrium so that i can create a bootable usb dvd disk to run the restore from , just in case of a worst case problem yes , file history is only intended for your personal data files it requires an external drive , like a sd card or usb drive file history is 'automatic' and constant , while win7 macrium is a long interval manual process unfortunately for me file history is not working for some reason is it not recognizing the option for it to automatically delete files when space is needed , so it keeps whining about no space on my backup drive there is a 3rd option that is to use onedrive it will automatically backup your defined folders to the cloud that is if you do n't mind sharing your personal files with the cloud __eou__	Agent
PA	i personally use system image which is still available in windows 10 learn how to create a system image in the following article http answers microsoft com en us windows wiki windows 10 win upgrade how to create a system image in windows 10 84fa6683 e3ac 4e93 9139 368af9267869 instructions how to restore the image if needed http answers microsoft com en us windows wiki windows 10 update how to restore a windows 10 system image to an e20992ca 5641 4f7c bb09 3895d0732162 microsoft is planning to deprecate both system image and file history in the future macrium reflect and easeus todo backup , both available in free versions are two options i recommend check out the following article how to use both https www groovypost com howto create windows 10 system image best free alternatives __eou__	Agent

OQ	hello as a relatively new excel user \( excel for mac v 15 3 \) , i am struggling with what i thought would be a simple problem i have a table with multiple columns , each of which contains a list of selected integers between 1 and 340 these represent case numbers in an audit , with each column containing only those numbers which are positive with respect to the particular criteria defined by that column so the values are never repeated within the same column i want to copy the value in each cell of the column to a new column , but with the row number defined by the value in that column \( only alternate columns a , c , e are filled , leaving b , d , f etc for the returned results \) so , for example , if the first three cells a1 , a2 , a3 in column a contain the values 83 , 41 , 279 , i want the formula to return the values 83 , 41 , 279 into cells b83 , b41 and b279 respectively it does n't matte that the intervening cells will be blank i then want to repeat the exercise for column c into column d , e into f etc if there is a way to do it for the whole spreadsheet at once that would be great , but even if i have to do one column at a time that would be acceptable any ideas appreciated __eou__	User
CQ_IR_PA	hi dave , for if the first three cells a1 , a2 , a3 in column a contain the values 83 , 41 , 279 , i want the formula to return the values 83 , 41 , 279 into cells b83 , b41 and b279 respectively it does n't matte that the intervening cells will be blank , is the screenshot below is what you mean \? if it s not related to your requirement , to know more clearly about your question , please describe more with screenshots thanks , rena paul __eou__	Agent

FD_FQ	thanks , paul , that is exactly what i mean i need to preserve some aspects of the data aside from the value when it is copied , for example the colour coding , like this \( there are actually dozens of columns of data \) bobmelanie has replied to suggest using row \( \) function i know i probably need to use this , but how exactly \? thanks for your help __eou__	User
PA	in b1 , ifna \( vlookup \( row \( \) , a a , 1 , false \) , \) copy down to b340 copy b1 to d1 , copy down to d340 , etc vlookup will look for the number of the row in the first column , and if it finds it , will put it in the current cell exactly as it is in the original cell ifna will replace the n a with a \( a blank cell \) if there is no match oh , if your excel is old enough that you do n't have ifna , you can use if \( isna \( vlookup \( row \( \) , a a , 1 , false \) , , vlookup \( row \( \) a a , 1 , false \) but it is clunkier __eou__	Agent
FD_PF	great ! that has essentially worked the only issue is that is has not preserved other aspects of formatting during the copy over , such as font colour , but i can work around that now that the values are in the right places thank you to benjamin and all who responded so promptly __eou__	User

FD_PF	somehow i have solved it this problem only appeared after updating office recently i went to the properties of a file saved as ppsx which would open in power point in the edit mode instead of opening as a slide show in the properties i went to change how it opens then clicked on power point and clicked apply and ok i saw that the icon had changed slightly and saw that the icons of all my ppsx files had slightly changed and all the ppsx files now open as a slide show and no longer in pp as an edit file don t know what happened but think that when you work in power point and save the file as a ppsx it really does not save it as a ppsx but as a pptx \( as it says it must in the options in the pp program ! ! \) by changing how it opens afterwards it has magically adopted the ppsx and changed all the files with that suffix to open as shows ! think it bypasses the glitch in the actual programme where it states in options save that it must save as a presentation with no alternative such as a show in power point click on file then on options and then on save there it says save files in this format there are four or five options but all are presentations and there is no option to select anything else although when you select power point show when you save the file it subliminaly saves it as a presentation as the options lays down in the properties of the file you select poer point again as the program to open the file , appl and ok and it accepts the ppsx suffix \( and all similar ones on your pc __eou__	Agent

OQ	split from this thread another xxxxxxxxxxx decision , like skype does n't close on windows when clicking in the x button in the window , or skype displays everyone as away even when this person selected 'offline' i never need the dial pad , why ca n't i disable it \? it 's a window inside a window __eou__	User
FD_PA	hello holly , welcome to skype community ! dial pad cannot be disabled this is a default interface of the skype application and it cannot be removed from the application the quickest way to close skype is to right click the skype icon displayed in the system tray at the bottom right of the screen or the skype icon from your menu bar , and select quit and it is unusual that your presence status is not appearing correctly on your contacts' end if that 's the case , we advise you to make sure the application is up to date we also advise for you to click a contact , type msnp24 on your chat box with the contact and click enter this will help in refreshing your presence status on skype i hope the information above helps regards , __eou__	Agent
FD	hi , i'm not talking about removing the dial pad , i'm talking about disable the pop up of the dial pad when i start skype i do n't need it and will never need it but it 's annoying that i have to close it every time windows skype when every other application on windows is closed terminated by clicking on the x , skype should behave the same ! it 's a break in the usability when just one application behaves differently and i'm not the only one who hates this behavior https www skypefeedback com forums 299913 generally available suggestions 9095569 fix the close x button there are also many people who do n't understand why skype is not closing https www google de search \? q windows close skype oq windows close skype aqs chrome 69i57j0l5 3577j0j7 sourceid chrome ie utf 8 __eou__	User

OQ	hello i will not accept cookies from bing com , so if that 's the only suggestion you have , then i politely request that you do n't suggest anything at all i 'll just switch to another search engine in the past , it used to be possible to disable safesearch by appending adlt off to the url \( example link \) now safesearch is always set to strict and that 's doubly strange because the dropdown menu says moderate \( default \) is there any way to turn it off without storing the preference in a cookie \? thank you in advance __eou__	User
PA	fwiw , the adlt off query parameter stills works for me in addition , i can adjust the safe search level on the bing images page using the drop down it may help to know that the regional area you have selected does play a part in the judgement calls assigned to different safe search levels i believe the most open setting in this regard is united states english or united states spanish check your worldwide settings at the following link bing worldwide of course , that might involve a cookie too so the point may be moot __eou__	Agent
FD_NF	thank you for the reply i have n't selected any specific region it looks like i'm getting the worldwide version by default it does n't help if i try forcing the region to united states english with mkt en us sample link and screenshot of the result https www bing com images search \? mkt en us q cookies adlt off also , the worldwide version is now completely broken without cookies thumbnails only load when placing the mouse cursor over them __eou__	User

FD_NF	i downloaded bing for ipad and signed in and did all kinds of searches but never got any more points it says i am signed in and all the links seem to work , but they turn out to be useless as far as getting bing points is concerned somehow , it seems that bing only gives pc credits for searches on my ipad i have a lifetime 3353 points , so obviously i am doing something right on my various pcs btw , i did what you said and i used the qr code on the website , it took me to my dashboard and showed me that i had not earned any mobile points , even though i did a number of searches after doing the qr code and signing in to bing with my microsoft account this is very frustrating __eou__	User

FD	i tried to wade through the faq but found nothing of value i have a feeling that we will just go round and round and find out that it is not possible to get mobile points on an ipad somewhere in the past i read that microsoft does not consider tablets to be mobile devices the main reason i started this thread was to see if there was any change of mind about that \( uniquely \) microsoft definition since nothing works , i'm guessing the answer is no meaning that microsoft still does not consider tablets to be mobile devices and all of our efforts to use tablets as mobile devices will not work if you have nothing more to add , then we can close this thread __eou__	User
FD_PA	found in bing rewards faq how do i earn credits when i search on my mobile device \? if you re using windows phone 8 or 8 1 , see bing rewards and windows phone 8 and 8 1 if you use ios or android , go to bing com rewards signin and sign in to your bing rewards account when you re signed in , at the bottom of the bing homepage or a bing search results page , you ll see bing rewards and your credit balance iphone , windows phone or android but not tablet __eou__	Agent
FD_NF	that looks about right but not tablet i had hoped ms would go along with the rest of the world and call a tablet a mobile device but , i'm sure they have financial reasons not to do that bing ca n't really be one of those reasons it 's some other greedy reason on their part __eou__	User

FD_PA	hi lisa thank you for your response and input wrt liveweb and win10 creator 's update i spent some time on it tonight and win10 1703 feature update \( creators \) seems to be the culprit in the scenarios i tested here 's some info from my trials i was able to do some further troubleshooting tonight and confirmed that the issue is only experienced after the windows 10 creators 's update i setup two vm 's \( 1 win10pro 1607 and 1 win10education 1607 \) i installed office 2016 pro plus on both vm 's and then liveweb with the respective registry entries modified as needed i then inserted a few liveweb slides and ran the presentation and the pages and files both were displayed on the first time through i then ran windows update on both vm 's and received the needed security patches up to but before the 1703 creator 's feature update i tested again with the presentation and the pages files displayed on the first go around my next update to both vm 's was the creator 's update 1703 feature update once that was loaded and systems rebooted i ran the presentations and both did not display the webpage files with liveweb \( while not resolved as of yet , i appreciate you guiding me to focus on the creator 's update ! i'm happy to have narrowed it down , at least in my mind to the cause and it helps me with a more concise work around for the immediate __eou__	User
FD_PF	lisa et al just an update after a little more troubleshooting again , i'm not a programmer and my troubleshooting is limited to more of an 'desktop' style this post 's purpose is to sharing information for others more than anything so , i decided to open task manager during the running of a slide with the liveweb control to see if i can see any process that were running with the thought of maybe getting a process explorer app installed and get more granular windows task manager looks like this when hitting the slide with liveweb \( screen shot inserted \) you 'll notice on the third process under microsoft powerpoint \( 32 bit \) \( 3 \) a process that just shows a window icon but does not provide any text to indicate what it is that line and icon do indeed represent the liveweb control this \( as stated in initial post \) confirms the add in is running correct and not erroring or being blocked in taskmanager if you right click that window icon and choose bring to front while on the first pass of viewing that slide the contents display \( so a second visit is not needed \) of course , this cannot be done or would not be effective while running the powerpoint presentation in my layman 's terms , i believe maybe the embedded control is loosing top window focus and therefore is not seen on the first visit to the slide i just do n't understand why if you go back \( or forward \) and then revisit the slide a 2nd time it then puts that window in the front workaround in place again , just sharing information that i am seeing my work around has been to create a custom slide show with only the slides that have the embedded control and let them cycle through once before the 'live' presentation begins i then stop the custom show \( without exiting powerpoint \) and run the full show all of the content on liveweb slides displays perfectly i am using the add in unlike most the liveweb control is used on 70 different slides to show individual pdf or png files liveweb has been a huge help to us i know most others would use it on one possibly two slides in a presentation hats off to shyamlisa ! __eou__	User

OQ	i have a new dell inspiron laptop 15 5000 which came with office 365 and skype free 60 minutes of calls per month i had previously used skype on my android phone with a friend on her mac laptop when i first set up the new laptop , skype seemed to set itself up after i synced my contacts my friend is moving out of the country in a few days , and we were practicing doing video calls on my new dell she called me first , and she was already a contact i did not know how to answer the call because i had no notification buttons on my open skype screen i managed to disconnect the call , and she called me back this time , there was a notification box at the lower right and had the answering options of audio or video i picked video and we connected she saw me on her end , and she also saw herself in the little box in the corner so that must mean her camera was working on my end , i saw myself in the little corner box , but i never saw her just her avatar in the center of the screen our audio was fine , just not the video i have a new dell so i am sure i must have the latest version of skype , but there is a problem i have no menu , and the only place i have to click on the skype page which first comes up from the desktop is check account or invite a friend on the left side of the page , there is only an option to check my contacts list when i click check account , i find an option for settings , but there is no tools or options within the settings list there is a privacy settings , but it all it does is show my profile the self help stuff i have found so far from googling is from skype support which says to go to tools and then to options and then to automatically receive video and make sure that either anyone or contact list only is checked that if nothing is checked then i wo n't be able to see any video so , i would do that if i could , but i have no way to get to tools in the first place there is nothing to click , no options at all i really need to figure this out quickly is my skype software corrupted \? do i need to download it \? if i did what would happen to my setup \? it came on my dell , so i never downloaded anything this is the first time i have used skype for windows 10 i was hoping it would be easier __eou__	User

OQ	i have a table with several columns the first column is dates , which i have on the x axis the date values starts at 2010 01 01 , with approx 10 days to next row \( 2010 01 10 etc \) , until 2010 06 14 then the next date is 2010 09 17 but in the chart excel automatically fills in the missing dates between 2010 06 14 and 2010 09 17 and the line between these dates is of course a straight line how can i avoid excel doing this stupid thing of adding dates that i have not entered myself \? __eou__	User
PA	maybe there are other ways of doing this but here is one trick until someon tells how it should be done extend your chart to have one more row than you have now and put somehing in the date column that is not a date , i e \( a single blank character \) no need to have data in the othe column on this row now excel will not try to interprete your dates as numbers and you will not get the gap filled the only effect is that the x axis is one item longer , but if you chose as your date there will just be a blank at the end of the x axis hope this helps william __eou__	Agent
PA	excel has automatically made the x axis a time axis you want it to be a text axis click on the x axis activate the layout tab of the ribbon horizontal \( category \) axis should be listed in the current selection group if not , you can select it now click format selection under axis type , select text axis click ok __eou__	Agent
PF	thanks for the answers actually both solutions above was needed , as i can see it i started with the secon , selected text axis then i got mysterious effect , millons of values then i tried the first tips , and was succesful but the axis did not display all values but it did when i selected text axis thanks __eou__	User

OQ	in microsoft excel how do you lookup a certain value in a row and then look up another value in that row and then count the amount of times that second value appears in the row is the question so in other words , the first value identifies the row the second value identifies what to look for in that row then instead of returning that exact value it returns the amount of times that value shows up in the specific row example so lets say you have a workweek sheet and a workweek summary sheet on the workweek sheet it highlights the workers and the work done at different times during the day on the summary sheet it uses that data to tell you who \( value 1 \) did what assignment \( value 2 \) and how many times they did it \( adding it \) of course that person would be doing different things during the day so it needs to be able to tell the difference \( case sensitive \) it does not need to tell you what time they did it since its based on a week that would be unnecessary data it just needs to tell you how many times they did a assignment during that week and since persons may change through out the week once you type in a name to search and work assignment it should auto change its total \( automated system i am looking for \) example code that did n't work but this is what i came up with match \( summary ! g 2 , index \( tuesday ! b 2 e 58 , match \( summary ! a5 , tuesday ! a 2 a 58 \) , \) \) summary ! a5 would be the person i look for in a row this is a vertical lookup of names \( summary sheet \) summary ! g 2 would be the assignment to look for on the workweek sheet but this \( text to look at \) is on the \( summary sheet \) tuesday ! b 2 e 58 would be the assignments to search through \( workweek sheet \) tuesday ! a 2 a 58 would be the row of names to search through \( workweek sheet \) its like a two way lookup but on the second look up it looks at the whole row and identifies all the matching values text in the row and adds the amount of times they show up __eou__	User

OQ	i'm on the mac and i'm running office 2016 my powerpoint work depends on being able to work with the color slides in grayscale view there used to be a grayscale view and it 's gone is there an add on \? desperate ! please help ! ! ! ! paul __eou__	User
PA	hi paul615 , it s not feasible for mac 2016 to use grayscale view we suggest you submit your requirement via office 365 uservoice uservoice is the best way to let related team know users' requirement , as well as perfect our products and service thanks for your understanding cherry __eou__	Agent
PA	if you know how to run a macro you could try sub grayme \( \) activewindow blackandwhite msotrue ' \( msofalse for color \) end sub does n't give much control but might do what you need __eou__	Agent
PA	your observation about grayscale is correct unfortunately , grayscale commands are badly damaged in powerpoint 2016 a sloppy work around is to use file print in the full print dialog \( you may have to click the print dialog 's disclosure triangle to see this \) , choose grayscale for the output and then print to a pdf file __eou__	Agent
PF	thank you so much for your reply i heard that windows 365 has the grayscale view i'm thinking of installing windows on my mac your thoughts \? by the way , i give you props for coming up with an add on but as you stated it does n't work in 365 mac it does sort of ha ha i installed it it does n't give you options and it 's hard to get back to the color look but at least you can see what it looks like on the screen i think you so much ! paul __eou__	User
PA	all i can suggest is sending feedback to microsoft begging them to repair the features that were broken between 2011 and 2016 click the smile button in powerpoint to get your request to microsoft i checked powerpoint for windows and grayscale is still working there here 's a screen shot from windows powerpoint options __eou__	Agent

OQ	i have an embedded spreadsheet in a powerpoint presentation it is kept on a sharepoint site and updated by about 7 people 1 time per week for some reason , seemingly out of nowhere , one of us will open the sheet and edit it , then click out of it to keep the changes and it resizes much bigger the font is still listed at the same font and size , but it no longer keeps the sizing format any idea why \? we all use the same os and we are not on tablets or anything every time this happens , i have to recreate the spreadsheet __eou__	User
IR	hi jeremy , the changes in sizing format will actually depend on how the other users edit the spreadsheet you mentioned that the presentation is being updated and edited by 7 users does this issue happens on all the embedded spreadsheet in powerpoint \? we would also appreciate if you can provide us a screenshot of the issue so we can have a better view of your concern __eou__	Agent

OQ	i have a table with a column of time stamps these come from an external source and the cell is configured as custom h mm i have created a 2nd table with deduplicated values of the time stamps then i am using a vlookup function to match the values from the deduplicated table to the original one some of the return values are correct , while others are incorrect , and i do n't understand why i 've tried to use value function and change the columns to another form of data other than time , but it did not work this is an example from the original table column a is the time stamps and column b is the return values from the second table \( below \) 0 11 11 1 06 18 1 09 21 1 11 23 2 06 15 2 05 29 1 03 11 2 10 34 1 02 11 2 06 15 2 06 15 6 06 78 3 05 14 this is the second table i have created 0 11 11 1 06 18 1 09 21 1 11 23 2 06 30 2 05 29 1 03 15 2 10 34 1 02 14 6 06 78 3 05 41 as you can see , values like 0 11 , 2 05 and 6 06 return correctly , while values for 2 06 and 3 05 do not i have no idea why this is happening any ideas \? p s the source of the original time stamp comes from a very old external software and there is no way to reimport the data differently __eou__	User
IR_PA	first , show us the vlookup formula in fact , show us all formulas and add cell references to your table details are important second , as a wild guess , if you use vlookup without a 4th parameter or 1 or true in the 4th parameter , there are two possible problems 1 the values in column a are not in ascending order 2 there might be binary arithmetic anomalies , such that two values that look the same actually differ infinitesimally \( and perhaps invisibly \) in their binary representation i suggest that you upload an example excel file \( redacted \) that demonstrates the problem to a file sharing website \( e g box net files \) so that we can see the details better post the public share url in a response here please test the url first , being careful to log out of the file sharing website __eou__	Agent

OQ	hello , i have office 365 subscription and i just installed the latest version of windows \( windows 10 creator \) where the 3d tools in powerpoint is supposed to show in the insert menu , but it does not any idea what i need to do to get this new feature i am really looking forward to using it appreciate your help ! thanks __eou__	User
IR_PA	it will probably help if you go to file account and post a screenshot of what you see __eou__	Agent
PA	as debra 's alluded to , whether you get the latest features will depend on which version of office 365 you have do you already have morph as one of the options on the transitions tab \? if not , then almost certainly you do n't have a version of office that receives feature updates if you do have morph , then we 're off to a good start next step go to file account and opt in to the insider program , which allows you to receive new features early on , before they 're more generally released i'm fairly sure that 3d options are not yet generally out there then force powerpoint to update you may need to do this a time or three , quitting and restarting it in between that 's what it took to get 3d and some of the other newer features to appear here __eou__	Agent
FD	thanks john , below is a screen shot i have morph and other new features in ppt i also have paint 3d on my laptop after i have installed the latest version of windows __eou__	User
FD_PA	thanks jeffrey i already have morph in the transition tab i also opted into the insider program and forced an update 2 3 times and restarted my computer as you suggested but still no 3d tools tab i realize the roll out was in phases but today on social media , there has been a couple of tweets from microsoft and others that seem to suggest it has gone mainstream https twitter com microsoftgulf status 907906826330624000 __eou__	User

OQ	anybody know how to get the toolbars to display in the vba editor in excel for mac \? tried closing and re opening the editor , tried uninstalling office , rebooting , reinstalling office , applying all the office updates , rebooting no change tried running the vba code i found in a bunch of posts to make the toolbar visible no change macos sierra v 10 12 6 on a 2016 macbook pro __eou__	User
PA	hi eric , this is supported in the insider fast builds of office 2016 for mac , the 15 39 version of excel 2016 for mac you can check the information below excel 2016 for mac release notes for insider fast builds bringing back visual basic ide to office for mac to get the 15 39 version , please open any office 2016 for mac application , such as word , excel , powerpoint , onenote , or outlook on the help menu , select check for updates select the check box to join the office insider program , and then choose insider fast or slow from the menu thanks , renamelinda __eou__	Agent
PA	just in case you are n't aware participating in the insider fast program means receiving what actually are pre release versions of updates iow , you 're agreeing to test new updates before microsoft deems them safe for distribution to the general population accordingly , you are leaving yourself open for new bugs issues which may impact productivity if you rely on your office software for more than being a guinea pig it would be a good idea to assess whether the risk is worth the reward of being the first kid on the block to get the new toys \) this is a point that melinda yu seems to have overlooked the revised version of the updates typically arrives for the rest of the world in a matter of only 1 2 weeks following the insider fast release __eou__	Agent
FQ	melinda , thanks for taking the time to reply what you said makes perfect sense would you know why when i try checking for updates from my excel for mac v 15 38 select office insider slow , i get the message that there are no updates available \? thanks again keneric __eou__	User
PA	hi eric , bobsteven is right , before you update to the insider version , you can refer to what he says after you know the insider program , you can select insider fast to update to 15 39 version the 15 38 version was just released from insider slow there s no insider slow version currently the 15 39 is in the insider fast now thanks , renamelinda __eou__	Agent
PA	hi eric , the tests of the new visual basic for applications vbe editor turned out really well everyone i know loves it the normal progression for updates is insider fast \( pre beta \) becomes insider slow \( beta \) insider slow becomes general release insider fast builds are weekly \( sometimes even more often \) insider slow and general release are monthly insider slow comes out about week before general release and is usually the same build right now , the 15 39 insider fast build has a peculiarity where everything in excel is upside down and mirrored in sierra and high sierra i think they will have to fix that before it goes to insider slow once that is figured i expect that new editor will be moving to the next stage \( insider slow \) __eou__	Agent

OQ	hi , i'm having several problems i cannot open the game bar it says ca n't save your recording make sure that your captures folder allows files to be saved i'm also unable to open the folder my captures are saved to from the game dvr panel in settings also , when i go to game bar in settings and try to move the slider across to record game clips , screenshots and broadcast using game bar it will let me do it but then when i switch screens and go back it is unsaved and i ca n't get it to permanently stay on all i have done is copied then deleted my current videos , pictures and documents and game screenshots across from the pc to a usb drive for record keeping and then i deleted the folders \( except game screenshot folders like steam and world of screenshots \) so i could start clean with them because videos i have take up alot of storage it should n't have been a issue though i thought because the folders i deleted we 're inside the primary pc user folders like documents , downloads , pictures and videos i do n't know what 's happened and i ca n't even take a screenshot to show you guys but i 'd like to get it fixed thanks __eou__	User
PA	hi kristopher , issues with saving your video clips or using the game bar on windows 10 are possibly caused by an outdated xbox app or a corrupted folder on windows explorer to resolve your concern , we suggest that you move your saved video clips to another folder within the pc the next saved videos will automatically go to the new folder if the issue persists , reset windows store to clear the store cache then , uninstall and reinstall the xbox app to manually update it by following the steps below to reset windows store to update the xbox app you can also sign in to another use to isolate if there is an issue with your profile if you need further assistance , do n't hesitate to reply to this post anytime __eou__	Agent
PA	solution move the original captures folder back to it 's original location make sure you do n't just copy and paste it , you need to cut and paste the folder so it properly goes back to it 's former location which can take some time to do once that is complete , if you want to move your pictures and or videos across to usb or another location open your captures folder and select all your files then cut and paste them into a new folder on your usb or other location the game bar will still work because it can find the captures folder in it 's original location and all the settings will be restored hope this resolves your question __eou__	User

PA	autotext entries are stored in templates by default , they are stored in the normal template , normal dotm only autotext entries stored in normal dotm will generate autocomplete tips , but they can be stored in any template you can create a special template that users can load as an add in if the template is stored in word 's startup folder , it will be loaded at startup , and autotext entries in the template will be available to all documents if users want to be able to take advantage of autocomplete , they can move the autotext entries from the add in to normal dotm using the building blocks organizer select any entry , click on edit properties , and , in the save in dropdown , change the location from the add in to normal dotm __eou__	Agent

FQ	this is where it gets confusing and having out of date support materials does n't help do i assume that if you created a skype account some time ago , by creating a skypename , then the skypename will appear under your 'real name' as illustrated here https support skype com en faq fa10858 what s my skype name if you create a skype account today you cannot create a skypename and thus it will not appear under your 'real name' as \( erroneously \) illustrated in the above support link \? __eou__	User
PA	thank you for your response even if you re using a microsoft account to sign in on skype or if you re using a newly created account using email or phone number , the default skype name will show on the profile below the display name which has the word live if it s not showing on your device try using a different device and sign in on skype application and check on the skype name of your account also , the support site only shows the example on where you can see the skype name of your account hope this information helps thanks __eou__	Agent

PA	it has been my experience that there are varying 'levels' of point of interest detail and that you receive more information as you zoom in into a map at the 1000ft scale \( lower left corner \) , only what could be considered landmarks are evident but zooming into 500 250 100ft levels produces additional businesses and traveller annotations \( e g gas station icon \) this actually makes some sense as the map would be pretty cluttered at lower zoom levels if everything was indicated on the map at once zooming in provides more 'real estate' to show details __eou__	Agent

FQ	paul , thanks a bunch for this ! it works great can you explain what it all means , though it just would be helpful in case parts of it can be used in other functions i looked up quote field , but i could n't find anything about set den also , where do i insert a switch code to hide zero values \? thank you ! __eou__	User
PA	the set field creates a bookmark \( in this case , named den 'denominator' abbreviated \) the value of that bookmark is given by the formula txt2 0 txt3 0 txt4 0 txt5 0 txt6 0 0 which simply provides a count of how many of txt2 txt6 are greater than 0 the if test compares the den value against 0 and , if it 's 0 , displays 0 as the result if it 's non zero , the formula \( txt2 txt3 txt4 txt5 txt6 \) den calculates the average of the non zero values the quote field simply serves as a wrapper to ensure the set if fields update as a group __eou__	Agent

PA	what the other gents have said is true , however , since there is some likelihood of problems when installing or activating fsx \( fixes that 'mostly' work are available \) , most are switching over to fsx steam edition this is from dovetail games and under limited licence , they have improved the old fsx substantially apart from it now becoming a 64 bit piece of software \( giving a better vas , plus others \) , it can only be downloaded \( which means that you always have a copy on your external media \) and also needs no activation as well , fsx steam is basically fsx with the acceleration module included and for the best part , it sells for around usd25 \( basic version \) you can also buy the basic version with various other inclusions for a higher cost http store steampowered com app 314160 microsoft flight simulator x steam edition __eou__	Agent

OQ	hi , i am struggling to figure out why when i press the bullet button to format the texts in the table , the bullet only formats the first line break for example , if i copy an excel text from a cell with line breaks like this apple oranges cabbage and paste it into a powerpoint table cell and press bullet , only the first bullet will have a bullet while the others have hanging indents like this apple oranges cabbages i would like the text within the table cell to look like this apple oranges cabbages currently , i have to manually create the bullets by erasing the pre made line breaks from excel and pressing enter however , this can get tedious is there a way to fix this problem \? thank you __eou__	User

CQ_FD	the line breaks were inserted manually using alt enter i selected the cell , not the text to copy all the tables in powerpoint at once __eou__	User

PA	your tables appears to have merged split cells the errant behaviour seems to have been caused by a recent office update see https support office com en us article after installing kb 3213656 or kb 4011039 merged table cells don t work correctly in word or outlook 8c7af9eb 9e48 4e1e 8c13 6340ede4acdc __eou__	Agent

FD	your instructions were clear and useful for finding the new calculator here 's the issue the new calculator is big and bulky it looks great in many ways but it 's not practical for those that use it often it covers too much screen especially when you use the extra functions the original calculator was n't flashy but it was smaller and more practical when using extra functions i use scientific settings for more complex math on the left of the screenshot below is the classic calculator \( which i found via youtube but some may not want to go to third parties to reinstall this \) on the right is the new calculator the old one is smaller and easier to use taking up much less screen room when working with other windows the new one is big and bulky and not very practical i for one , and i'm certain there are many others , would appreciate the choice of which one to use please please add this option to a future update to windows 10 thank you ! __eou__	Agent

RQ	why is n't the mail app usable \? i do n't work for microsoft , so all i can offer is an educated guess outlook exposes a lot of its features to external programs that might want to use them for example , when i add a new contact to outlook , i like to add information to several fields that are scattered across three or four entry screens and require me to click in all sorts of arcane places just to get to major pain so i wrote a little vb app that collects the info i want to add then wakes up outlook , adds a new contact and plugs in the data i 've entered boom done it 's this kind of thing that allows the ppt team to build in features that access outlook to send presentations by mail my guess is that the simple mail app does n't provide this kind of access to external programs __eou__	Agent

FD_IR_PA	hi meredith and welcome to the skype community ! q1 how is this possible that this contact appears suddenly on my list without being searched a if you are using the new skype available for users with android nougat 7 0 and marshmallow 6 0 os and for ios users with ios version 9 and higher , then this is a new feature wherein it would be easier for you to find your friends and family on skype q2 how come this new contact is not visible on the list for my existing contact and finally how did it started showing no mutual contact after a day \? a that is quite strange we need to check that further so i can get a better view of your concern please provide us a screenshot of what you can see on your contact list on the skype application please also provide your skype version and ios version of your device thank you __eou__	Agent
OQ_RQ	i , too , suddenly found a slew of mutual contacts at the top of my contact list i do not want to see my friends' contacts ! how can i get rid of them \? __eou__	Agent
FD	hi , the ability to not see such extended profile listings does not seem possible with new skype that 's what the official helpers have said in response to similar questions before i believe it is possible to avoid your own profile being shared similarly by disabling the setting for show my presence to others in real life , i do not bounce up to unknown people who are visiting my neighbours and try to be friends with them that 's dog behaviour ! yet it is what skype implicitly thinks we should be doing ! i guess it will make the skype development team easy to spot at corporate functions they 'll be the ones running around the room pushing their noses into everyone 's crotches __eou__	Agent
FD	hi zacharyfornash and cestquelalexa homme the feature to disable this is currently not available although , you can change your privacy settings so that your account would not appear on contact suggestions follow these steps below disabling show my presence to others will make your presence status to invisible , this does n't prevent you from showing on suggestions i understand that this might be inconvenient for some users do n't worry , we are collating feedbacks posted here in the community to pass along to the appropriate support team for review thank you __eou__	Agent
NF	thank you for clarifying that aspect of one 's inability to be promoted to any number of unknown third parties i am quite shocked it 's appalling twice over once that they do it , and further because you cannot even pay for a version that does n't default to 100 privacy i'm not convinced that the feedback options \( which i have exercised already \) are talking to the right people , as the comments are going back to the same team who already got it so badly wrong the feedback needs to be delivered at least one tier higher __eou__	Agent

PA	hi , quoting works a little quirkily we 're planning to make it more intuitive , but for the moment here 's how it works the first step is to do what you do , right click and select quote this places the message to be quoted in clipboard the second step is to paste in the chatbox this adds the quote to input field and you can type your message below it the thinking at the time was that this would make it easier to pick a quote from one chat and send the quote in another chat but the drawback is that it 's not so discoverable we 'll try and make it better in a future update hope this helps , rachel __eou__	Agent
FD_PF	when i quote and then paste into the chatbox it works perfectly i think i was confused because quote works different in skype web and skype for android \( it is not necessary to paste in these versions \) thanks for the clarification and help __eou__	User

PA	i you are physically printing the images and distributing them , then you can do this under the print rights for bing maps https www microsoft com maps product print rights html however , this does not sound like what you want to do if you want to use bing maps in qgis you can use the openlayers qgis plugin https plugins qgis org plugins openlayers plugin since this would be used internally within your company , you would require a bing maps known user license you can find out more about this by reaching out to the bing maps licensing team at email address is removed for privacy __eou__	Agent

OQ	i have recently created a new skype account for my elderly mother so she can speak with family as we live far away i used the skype app on ipad and used her mobile and newly created outlook address to create the account i also specified her skype name as something sensible yet her skype name in her account is now specified a cid \( some numbers \) oulook com i ca n't see a way of changing this for her can i change this \? if yes how \? if not why not \? the above format seems pretty useless __eou__	User
PA	hello christine , welcome to skype community forum ! unfortunately , we no longer have the option to customize skype name , upon creation at present , we only have 2 options to sign up for skype account 1 \) using mobile number and 2 \) using an email address both sign up process will provide you a skype account but the skype name is pre determined by our system if you sign up using mobile number , your skype name is live alphanumericdigits \) called lightweight account and if you sign up using email , your skype name is your email address i can understand that you 're used to having skype separated with microsoft however , as you know skype is now a program being owned by microsoft and the main reason why you are unable to create a separate skype account is to align skype 's usages and policy with microsoft as a part of our one microsoft program hope this information helps you a lot ! __eou__	Agent
CQ_FD	hi jee , thank for your reply i totally get that skype is now integrated with microsoft and my question was n't really about tryng to creating a separate for skype from microsoft account also understand the skype id is system generated could the id not be in an \( imho \) more human friendly format though \? live 7 e \( 16 random digits and letters \) \? the practical user problem i'm trying to solve is how is this person found in a skype directory by others \? her name is very common so searching for that comes up with many matches so i assumed skype id would be used to differentiate but 16 random digits and numbers into skype search is not very user friendly i created the account on ipad i expected to need an outlook live email to create it so had set a free one up when creating the account i think i entered both a mobile phone number and outlook email during the sign up process but hard to recall how would i go about making the outlook email the id then for an existing account \? it 's not jumping out at me i the account section nb my own skype and microsoft account \( that i'm logged in with here \) are still separate but that 's purely because i set both up a long tome ago and have not linked then up yet my query is however not about my own account jana __eou__	User
PA_PF	hello christine , you are most welcome ! upon creating the skype account using the mobile number it will generate a skype name , this is to protect your personal information but if you have put in an email address , this account can be search using the same email address just want to inform you that when you put the email address upon creating the account , this certain email address can t create another skype account hope this information helps you a lot ! __eou__	Agent

NF_OQ	for several years , i have had a powerpoint file that has several graphs that are linked to data and graphs in an excel file formerly , i could update the excel file , which updates the graphs , and all graphs update when i open the powerpoint file before 2016 , i could copy a graph , then paste special using keep source formatting and link data option graphs would update as data was changed in excel or at least when the ppt file was opened when a right click was done on the graph in ppt , there was an update link option sometime during 2016 , existing graphs update in ppt , but new graphs do not the copy , paste special , keep source formatting and link data option still appears normal , but now , the update link command is not active in powerpoint , and the only way to update more than one graph in ppt is to go to excel , and copy and paste each graph in place of the old one microsoft customer service told me on 6 23 2017 that now only one graph from an excel file can be linked at a time , and if i have 10 charts , that i need to have auto updated , that i should use 10 excel files wow let 's go backwards about ten years ! microsoft told me that the graph that i want to link to should be the active page when the excel file is opened all instructions that i have seen on youtube etc say to do it just like i have been any ideas \? microsoft any updates on this \? why it was done \? is it a bug or a feature \? __eou__	User

PA	since we recently encountered this problem , i thought it would help to share our findings the issue is that excel for mac does not properly 'parse' the information in the header cells so if you have carriage returns or line breaks in your header row , the field values will look wrong the fix is to edit the header rows of the source and remove any carriage returns or line breaks this will not fix any existing pivot tables , but the field list will display properly for new pivot tables __eou__	Agent

OQ	the historical weather information for payson arizona is reported incorrectly in the ms weather application ms reports that the historical data is provided by weather trends international i have contacted them and they have advised that they have not provided payson historical weather data to ms and also determined that the data appears to be the same as scottsdale arizona it seems that there must be programming that looks for a close geographic city and provides that data as an accurate representation of the area payson is a mountain community located 5 , 000 feet above scottsdale our climate is significantly different from scottsdale with actual historical variance 10 to 20 degrees different on average from those shown in the ms weather app i assume that if the ms weather app programming looks for close geographic cities , when the program does not have actual information from weather trends international , it is being repeated for many small cities across the country and perhaps the world why is this a big deal \? many folks looking for places to vacation or retire will look at the ms weather app for payson arizona and assume that the current and historical data is accurate when they see historical averages of highs and lows that are 10 20 degrees higher than the real actuals , they will assume payson weather is like phoenix and drop it from consideration to others who live in smaller communities across the country , please check the historical temperature and rainfall data for accuracy perhaps this is only an issue for payson __eou__	User

NF	thanks for the reply stephanie , this problem has existed for quite a while both in win 8 1 , where i clicked the send feedback button within the app to explain the problem and also in win10 where i clicked on the smiley face to provide windows feedback of this problem in the weather app in the feedback i explained the problem in some detail and was advised , when i submitted the feedback , that i would not get a response and thank you i assumed that someone at microsoft \( ms \) monitors the feedback and investigates the problems in both cases i waited to see a fix and after months , never saw the fix i have looked at other cities and it appears that historical data is correct , just not for payson when i saw online that microsoft identified the vendors who provide the data for the weather app , i contacted the source for historical information and they responded in an email to my problem payson is not one of the cities that they provide data for and their research indicated that the payson historical info was the same as scottsdale they suggested that this is a microsoft app problem and that i should contact microsoft knowing that no results were achieved when reporting through send feedback within the app i thought it might be appropriate to send a request to the microsoft community and hope some one would read my problem glad i was heard and you replied to the problem i have validated the error on 3 pcs , two of which are running win 10 and one on win 8 1 all give the same incorrect results i attempted to run the troubleshoot problems script , but it failed because it does not yet work on win 10 regardless i do n't think the problem is on my computers but in the way the application is programmed to provide historical data when a city does not have information from a source let me know if there is anything else i can do or information i can provide to better explain the problem thanks , paulsamantha __eou__	User

FD_OQ	i have a strange issue i have a samsung smart pc and my father a dell latitude 10 both with w8 pro updt 1 we have an home in menton paca france so we have put the place in the bing weather favorites my father started to say that his menton is wrong , on the weather map it 's in the wrong place \( more the 100km away \) and he thinks even the temperatures are wrong i checked on my tablet and on the weather map is in the correct place and we have different temperatures and even the skiing place are different \( his skiing place are far haway \) , both updated on the same time there is only one menton in france so the place is correct i tried removing the place , uninstalling the app but on his tablet is still wrong i just found that the same issue happen on my sister desktop but on all my 4 windows 8 device it 's correct , even on my wp8 it 's correct maybe i used the current place function in the app once i was there but i'm not sure , anyway there is something very wrong here this is my sister weather map http 1drv ms 1kbrywc this is my weather map http 1drv ms 1kbs9hy how is possible something like that \? how can i solve this issue \? thanks __eou__	User
PA	hi , right click on the weather map lower right click on refresh does the location correct itself \? try the app troubleshooter http windows microsoft com en us windows 8 what troubleshoot problems app 1 \) the bing weather app can detect where you are and display the local weather swipe up from the bottom of the screen or right click with your mouse tap or click the button marked current location you can also right click on the app and select current location type in a post code and verify if the app changes to the correct location 2 \) you can set any location you 're viewing in the weather app as the default home on the location 's weather page , swipe up from the bottom of the screen or right click with your mouse tap or click the set as home button 3 \) the bing weather app automatically refreshes its data frequently , but you can also have it refresh instantly swipe up from the bottom of the screen or right click with your mouse tap or click the refresh button __eou__	Agent
FQ	thanks for your reply , of course i already did everything you mentioned and everything is mentioned in the troubleshooter we do n't live in menton , so the only solution could be use the current location the first time i will be there , but even if it could solve the issue on my father tablet i ca n't move there my sister desktop \) as i mentioned in my forst post it 's likely i used the current location on my tablet so now it 's in the correct position for me , but i'm not sure if i did that just courious , did you try finding menton on your system \? it 's in the correct position \? because if it 's in the wrong position maybe there is something wrong with the bing weather app , if so they must fix it \) thanks again __eou__	User
PA	when you type in current location , you may type the city , town you live in rather than a post code these are the stats i have for menton paca france \( fig1 \) , i changed from farenheit to celsius \( fig2 \) and \( fig3 \) shows menton paca france location if the ip address is not detected , the weather map will locate the server closes to your location and this may be as an example you 're in marseile but the server is detected in barcelona right click on start and select command prompt \( admin \) type ipconfig flushdns press enter retry setting the location in weather app __eou__	Agent
PF	thanks for your reply , i will try your suggestion anyway all our pc are on the same network i did a test on my sister pc , using the post code now show the correct position later i will do a test with my father 's tablet for him it 's the more important thing in the world \) thanks again __eou__	User

FD_OQ	hello i 've embedded a word document into an excel file everything works great , however , it looks ugly my main issues are when i click on the word file 's icon , the icon shows a bounding box around it the word file 's icon can currently be resized and repositioned anywhere in the excel document so , my questions are how do i get rid of the bounding box \? right now the embedded word file seems to be hovering over the excel file rather than contained within a cell how do i get the file icon to be the content of the cell \? finally , once the above has been achieved , how do i lock the icons size and position inside the cell \? thanks in advance __eou__	User
PA	hi amanda , to get the embedded word document icon to position inside a cell and lock it , please perform the following steps 1 adjust the icon bounding box 's height and width , and move it to position inside a cell 2 right click on the icon click format object properties move and size with cells ok 3 select the other cells right click on the selected area click format cells protection uncheck locked button ok 4 click tools in the top menu bar protection protect sheet ok for the requirement to make the bounding box of the embedded word document invisible , we can not achieve it we welcome and encourage you to share your idea through user voice many features have been designed or upgraded based on customers' ideas it is the best way to perfect our products thanks for your understanding , tinajessica __eou__	Agent
RQ	thanks for the reply i did as suggested however , the file icon is now no longer clickable meaning the icon is positioned perfectly but no word document opens when you click on it is this possible to fix \? __eou__	User
PA	hi amanda , you will need to uprotect the sheet and then click to open the embedded document thanks , tinajessica __eou__	Agent
NF	thanks for your reply however , that solution means the icon has a bounding box around it and can be moved around the spreadsheet the solution i need requires the icon to be static , contained within the cell , clickable , and have no bounding box if it ca n't be static , having the movement contained to the cell boundaries would be good enough __eou__	User
FD_PA	the direct answers to your initial 3 questions are a couple of points first foremost objects cannot be inserted into cells period what jessica attempted to describe as well as any other 'tutorials' you find may be well intended but are a misrepresentation of what actually is being done essentially , the object can be locked into position on a sheet so that it appears to be contained within a cell in truth , the object still floats on the surface of the sheet second keeping the object anchored in place requires 2 conditions as you 've found , however , with protection enabled the object icon is rendered as a static graphic cannot be opened although it is n't exactly what you want , the only option i can suggest is to insert a hyperlink to the document in a cell an icon could be included as well with the hyperlink in an adjacent cell the hyperlink will work even when protection is enabled to preserve the positioning of the icon a down side of this method , though , is that a copy of the document is not embedded in the excel file , so a copy of the document must travel with the workbook __eou__	Agent

OQ	hi , is there any way in which i can sync my selected workouts and exercises with my windows 8 phone \( lumia 920 \) i have dug around but cant seem to find anything other than healthvault \( which is more of a medical data type of repository \) real pity if they do n't have something for this coz its a super app cant go to my gym with a windows 8 tablet ! ! ! but , my phone is always with me cheers allen __eou__	User
PA	it seems there is no special app for windows phones for using the diet and exercise trackers you can access your data though with the internet explorer on your windows phone by logging in to your healthvault account , but that s not half as comfortable as in a suitable app it s just a database s visualization in tables you can access the trackers at the start page under the point updates \( wonder if that s intentionally \) i hope that they will either add that functionality to the healthvault app \( which is quite useless for me at the moment \) or deliver bing health and fitness for windows phones , too it seems to be a really good app , even if still a bit buggy wanted to develop something alike just for myself \) __eou__	Agent

PA	once you have cleared the detect language automatically option , you should see no problem in new word documents old documents may already have incorrect language settings to fix those , you will have to change the language of the normal style for each document , and often you will also have to select all the content and re apply the correct language to re apply , use the language dialog box , but click ok instead of set as default __eou__	Agent

OQ	so i know i should do this via template there are a couple of reasons why i do n't so i wo n't get into it here my question is if i have a nice background in an image format , let 's say it 's 6mb if i copy that same image \( it does n't even have to be a background , it could be a logo \) 100x in a deck , does it increase the size proportionally , or is office storing an xml link to it internally and stores it once i suppose i could test this out , but on the road right now it is n't sheer laziness but at the same , answering once it would show up for others too so there you go thanks community __eou__	User
PA	i ca n't give you an absolute answer because you have n't indicated which release of the program you 're using there could be some degree of difference based on that in ppt 2016 , it depends on how you insert the background the same would hold true for a template there 's nothing to be gained in this respect it 's a matter of how the file template is built just one piece of friendly advice , on the subject \) imho there is absolutely no justification for using images of that size in ppt presentations , whether as backgrounds or otherwise i 'd highly recommend using a decent image editing program to process the image to the appropriate image file type , print dimensions resolution __eou__	Agent
PA	this is simple enough to test insert any random picture or paste in a screen shot , save the presentation , copy the picture a few times onto new slides , save again to a new name does the size of the presentation file increase trump bigly trump or just a little bit \? in the windows versions of ppt , for quite a few versions back , if you insert an image once then copy paste it to other slides within the same presentation , ppt stores only one instance of the image and points to it from the other slides it actually even tries to do this when you insert the image several times \( via insert picture \) if it figures out that you 've inserted an existing pic a second time , it uses the original i 'd be quite surprised if the mac version does n't do the same thing \( at least the current version \) but so as not to totally somewhat disagree with yolanda \( a bad idea as a rule \) he 's completely right that there 's almost never any need to pop images that large into ppt __eou__	Agent
PA	your analysis is correct if you insert copy an image , then paste it repeatedly it does not increase the file size measurably beyond what the initial instance caused the same appears to be true if you insert the same image multiple times however , that does n't apply to backgrounds , which is what i understood to be the frame of reference \) i have n't tested with the effect if using layout masters , though __eou__	Agent
FD_IR	interesting so i did a quick test added three blank slides to a new presentation in win ppt 2016 insider fast formatted one slide with a picture background and saved it then formatted the second slide with the same picture b g and saved it to a new name then did the same to the third slide , saved to another new name all of the files are exactly the same size a couple bytes so maybe a mac version buglet is what you 're seeing \? __eou__	Agent
FD	prompted by your reply i did some more testing oddly enough i'm now getting the same result of no increase in file size the result is the same regardless of whether saving to the same file or as separate ones my only explanation for the discrepancy is that it 's possible i may have been using different versions of the same image in my earlier attempt __eou__	Agent

FD_PA	first , formulas will not hide or unhide rows or columns you can apply a filter to the data and set up the criteria you want when a condition is applied to a filter , then the rows that do n't meet that condition will be hidden regards , laura ogilvy __eou__	Agent
FD_FQ	sound interesting enough , can you , please , give me some more details \? __eou__	User
FD_PA	select your data , go to the home tab , go way to the right and select sort filter in the editing area then select filter this should put dropdowns in the top row of your data go to the column with date and choose number filters you can then specify your criteria you example shows spain , 15 10 2017 i am assuming that this means spain is in say a2 and 15 10 2017 is in b2 then the filter dropdown selected would be for column b you would select date filters , then go to the bottom of the list and select custom you would get the dialog i show in the image there you would go to the left dropdown and select the condition , then enter the date in the right textbox then click ok this will hide the rows that do n't meet the condition you would to sort filter and select clear in the menu dropdown to clear the filter \( or click filter to remove the dropdowns if you wish \) you can filter on multiple columns say if you wanted to look at just portugal after 15 10 2017 as an example __eou__	Agent

OQ	hi i just read this article announcing september feature update for office for iphone and ipad \( version 1 25 \) and i ca n't quite get how the powerpoint for ios laser pointer feature works the article reads a new way to use the laser pointer in powerpoint presenter view , point your phone at the screen , then press and hold in the notes area to turn your device into a laser pointer \( feature requires an office 365 subscription and is available only on iphones do i have a slide deck loaded in presenter view on my laptop and have the iphone connected via bluetooth to act as a laser pointer \? and if so where in the notes area of which device \( laptop \? \) the powerpoint app is connected to my work office365 subscription could anyone point me to a more elaborate explanation \? thank you in advance panos __eou__	User
PA	the subject title is a little misleading it does n't actually turn your phone into a laser pointer instead , when you are using an iphone hooked to a projector , you can touch the screen of the iphone and a red dot will appear on the projected image \( you ca n't see it on the iphone because your finger tip covers it \) you 're showing the deck from your iphone , not a separate computer __eou__	Agent
CQ_FD	hi michele thanks for the quick response yes i am of course aware that the phone does n't turn into a laser pointer but a virtual one but i thought i could use the iphone as a tracker for my finger for example in order to show a laser pointer dot on a bluetooth connected laptop running powerpoint what you say makes sense , sadly i was expecting some of the features of the long lost office remote app for androids that i have yet to see for ios that was a very cool app again many thanks for the clarification panos __eou__	User
FD_PA	you can present directly from powerpoint on your iphone to an external display over airplay without using a laptop while holding your iphone in portrait orientation and presenting in powerpoint to an external display , presenter view will appear on the iphone and slide show will appear on the external display point your iphone at the center of the external display and press and hold your thumb on the notes pane in presenter view on the iphone the laser pointer red dot will appear in slide show now move your wrist to point at different parts of the screen and the red dot will move where you point __eou__	Agent
FD	bryan , the main problem i see with the solution above is that most businesses do not have the capability for an iphone or ipad to use airplay to connect to the projectors or tvs found in conference rooms , ballrooms , etc where business people given powerpoint presentations i think the best solution for any mobile device \( ios or android \) is to have powerpoint running on a windows or mac pc , connected to the projector , and then have the mobile device connected via bluetooth to the pc mac the reason this is important is that more customers are using tvs vs projectors normal laser pointers do not work on them also , if you are in a larger room with multiple displays , the laser pointer cannot display on all screens i saw a person use the android remote app today and it was impressive it would be a great addition for microsoft to support this thanks ! dewaynetammy hughes __eou__	Agent
FD_FQ	i agree with tammy on how businesses are set up laptops connected to projectors or hdtvs and the need to present standing up while pointing to things on the large screen needs either an external device that acts as a powerpoint presenter tool or the old android app that worked wonders and had functionality that is simply not there in the ios app after so much time i mentioned the android app funcctionality in my email last year are there really no other people working in offices seeking out this functionality \? panos __eou__	User

PA	somehow i have solved it i went to the properties of a file saved as ppsx which would open in power point in the edit mode instead of opening as a slide show in the properties i went to change how it opens then clicked on power point and clicked apply and ok i saw that the icon had changed slightly and saw that the icons of all my ppsx files had slightly changed and all the ppsx files now open as a slide show and no longer in pp as an edit file don t know what happened but think that when you work in power point and save the file as a ppsx it really does not save it as a ppsx but as a pptx \( as it says it must in the options in the pp program ! ! \) by changing how it opens afterwards it has magically adopted the ppsx and changed all the files with that suffix to open as shows ! think it bypasses the glitch in the actual programme where it states in options save that it must save as a presentation with no alternative such as a show __eou__	Agent

FD_PA	hi linda , thanks for sharing your experience with us powerpoint 2016 for mac does n't have options to let you choose a specific browser when you open hyperlinks , it will invoke your default browser to open the page regarding your requirement , i suggest you go to powerpoint uservoice to submit your feedback which is the best way to let related team hear your voice you can also look through the comments to check whether you can find any clues regards , williamsharon __eou__	Agent
FD_PA	there really is n't anything microsoft can do to change this behavior it is dictated by apple and mac os and standards for making hyperlinks when an app \( any app \) wants to open a web page , it tells the operating system to open a web page and hands it the url there is no provision in mac os for telling the operating system which browser to open based on the hyperlink in order to implement your suggestion , the structure of hyperlinks would have to change to incorporate the preferred browser \( which might not even be available on a given computer \) within the hyperlink that kind of change would have to be made by w3c before apple , microsoft , or anyone else could take advantage of such a feature __eou__	Agent

OQ	a huge part of my work involves putting together msword documents with tons of hyper linked lists on each page word is supposed to allow one to setup as default for all links on a page or document open links in a new page as the target frame when a link is clicked which is supposed to append blank at the end of a link but there is a bug , that feature does n't work it works for setting up one link at a time , but if you re working with several hundred links on a page , setting one link at a time is a huge time waste or downright unfeasible is there a registry or some other fix for such a problem \? or does anyone know of an html editor that would allow as default open all links in a new window \? thanks ! __eou__	User

OQ	i'm trying to create a kiosk type presentation and i want additional info to pop up next to the mouse cursor when i hover over certain text image in a slide i 've been googling about it and so far , i 've only found out about the hyperlink bookmark screentip feature but with this method though , i am quite limited in the number of characters i can use and also , there 's no text formatting \( layout , indentation , new line space , etc \) i only end up with a square wall of text is there another way of achieving what i have in mind without having to create another slide for it that simulates a pop up text box \? i simply want a simple looking tooltip that can contain somewhat extensive text descriptions in a easy to read layout and so far , google does n't seem to want to lead me to the right place so here i am instead also is it possible to simply have a small image \( a drawing of a clipboard with a few click able links on it \) to slide in after i click on something on the current slide \? to elaborate the current slide has many interactive images \( action buttons \) in it , one of which is a small shape \( or an image of a button \) with the text hints in it i would like it to be able to click it so that a drawing of a clipboard would then slide in the said clipboard drawing also contains a few more interactive buttons in it clicking on the hints button again would hide the clip board now , while the clipboard is still present on the screen , i still want to be able to have access to the other buttons that are already present prior to having the clipboard slide in how would you go about this \? the only way i could think of right now is to duplicate the slide , add the clip board image on the duplicated slide and then have the hints button on the first slide link to the duplicate slide \( with the clipboard present \) and then link the hints button on the duplicate slide to the first slide \( the one without the clipboard \) i think that method is very time consuming and duplicating stuff might end up drastically enlarging the file size is there a much more efficient way of achieving what i have in mind \? or is it not possible at all \? thanks in advance ! __eou__	User
PA	hello , as for creating the pop ups , you can use the screentip feature though if the feature will limit you when it comes to the amount of characters , an option is to use a duplicate slide on the duplicate slide insert the text box you wish to be the pop up and add your message to the box once you have the text box ready , select the text box and add animation to it perform the following steps if you have further questions , do not hesitate to reply on this thread __eou__	Agent

FD_OQ	hi all bing seems to handle scientific notation in numbers inconsistently \( and partly incorrectly \) steps to reproduce 1 \) go to bing com 2 \) type in 1 0e 02 10 0 3 \) the search suggestions container displays 10 which is correct 4 \) hit enter 5 \) bing 's result shows 2 918 expected behavior 1 \) bing should give 10 i have attached a screenshot showing the issue based on bing 's result page this is an issue with the number format not being recognized however this is standard scientific notation and google for instance parses it correctly i am using ie11 on a fully updated windows 8 1 since i do n't know any better place to report this to , i am posting it here __eou__	User

FD_PA	hi sarah thanks for the reply i still think the behavior in bing calculator is unexpected and should be fixed although i do recognize that there is a design choice to be made there but in any case , both results should be consistent the biggest problem however is that bing calculator is not consistent within itself input in bing calculator 1 \( 10000000000000000000 1000000000000000000 \) which gives the correct answer of 9 09090909e 20 copy and paste that value into bing calculator and divide by 10 9 09090909e 20 10 and you run into the same issue as above bing calculator 's output can therefore sometimes not be used as input to bing calculator which should be fixed imo all the best benedikt __eou__	User

PA	if you can print a test page from the printer , at least the printer 's hardware seems to be functioning when you mentioned that you ca n't print a test page from within device manager do you really mean from the devices and printers window \? that is , the usual method for printing test pages is to right click on a printer 's icon in devices and printers , select printer properties and use the print test page button from the general tab of the printer properties dialog the hp laserjet pro p1102 is one of hp 's lower cost host based printers this means that the computer itself is used to perform all of the print processing i'm not very familiar with this type of printer , but i 'll try to help you out open devices and printers if you go to control panel programs and features \( click start , type programs and features in the search box , and press enter \) , what hp software is listed there \? although you did n't specifically say so , it sounds as if you have at least one other printer installed on this computer is that an hp printer also \? microsoft used to have an automated fixit routine that solved a great many printer problems the article describing the fixit is still online at https support microsoft com en us help 2793718 you experience print spooler error messages after installing or upgrad like much of windows 7 support , however , microsoft retired this fixit , as you will see if you click the buttons on that page fortunately , the guts of that routine were saved by the microsoft print team and are still available , although things are not quite as automated as they once were the fixit has two modes , light and full although i suspect that the light mode will not fix your problem , it wo n't adversely affect your system and you may want to try it while i'm waiting for your response to the above questions the full mode may well solve your problem although it 's primarily intended for the more usual printer based printing problems i have n't used it on a system with a host based printer , but it should work here as well the catch with the full mode , however , is that it removes all printers , even those that are now working properly all printers would have to be freshly installed that 's one of the reasons i asked if you had other printers installed here are directions to using the fixit \( note that if you do n't include a parameter such as light after the name of the script , you 'll get a full description of what the script does in both light and full modes \) __eou__	Agent

OQ	i'm trying to create a custom table style that will always be 6 5 inches in width however when i go to create the new table style , the preferred width option in the table properties area is greyed out and unavailable does anyone know if there is a work around for this \? __eou__	User
PA	those properties that are dimmed are ones which cannot be included in a style definition table styles can include only formatting properties they cannot stipulate layout dimension properties , such as table or cell width height or number of columns rows what you might consider is saving a formatted table of the correct dimensions any other common attributes \( including content \) as an autotext item rather than trying to define a table style __eou__	Agent
PA	this seems like a rather arbitrary limitation as you can set the left and right indentation for a normal paragraph if i could use tabulations for my layout needs i could actually achieve what bonnie is trying to do in a normal style definition go to paragraph indentation left right and enter the distance to the margin you want then define your tab stops as your columns you might actually be able to put lines over and under the individual lines in order to achieve a table look best regards bullitjillshawn __eou__	Agent

PA	what may be a key factor imperial to metric often is not an exact equivalent in most software due to rounding for example , 5 does convert to 1 27 cm , but 75 converts to 1 9 cm because the absolute conversion value is 1 905 cm changing the margin to 1 91 cm \( especially if done for both top bottom or both sides \) in an existing document can be enough to cause the text flow problem if you want to change the measurement system in an existing document it 's best to to accept the conversion done by the program in most cases the text flow will not be altered significantly , if at all __eou__	Agent

OQ	my version of office is ms office 365 proplus , v 16 0 7466 i have data in excel , which i 've graphed in this example , a pie chart if i copy and paste the from excel using ctrl c ctrl v , i end up with a graph that looks like i want it to in fact , i can not only easily alter the size of the contents within it \( for example , if i want to adjust the legend so it 's a bit smaller , i can but , what i really want is to link it so , in word , i use paste special paste link , and choose microsoft excel chart object then click ok it pastes it 's linked i can double click on it and bring up the chart in excel this is good but i lose the ability to fine tune it such as alter the size of the legend within it if i do it within excel , it does n't seem to update the image within word my next step was to paste with link , but using the mso graphic object at that point , i seem to lose the link even though i specified to link \( trying an alt f9 seems to bear this out no link is displayed \) ideally , i 'd like to have the true link , as i use this report as a template , so i can do a search and replace and replace text within the to point to another file \( it works great when i do it ! \) am i doing something incorrectly , is there a bug , or is this a setting i have n't found \? is there a good primer i can read on ole cutting pasting that would clear things up \? thank you rich __eou__	User

PA	hi rich , by linking microsoft excel chart object you are good to bind data from excel chart to word chart physical attributes are localized like length breadth etc within excel word linking will bind data only between excel and word individually not the other local attributes like length breadth of chart object so , if you change the size of the legend in excel it will not reflect in word regards , daniel __eou__	Agent
FD_FQ	daniel thank you i like that explanation it helps me understand what 's going on one of the aspects of linking and embedding that tripped me up is copying a graph from excel \( using ctrl c \) and pasting into word using ctrl v if i right click on the object , i do not see the update command when i right click on the graph in word neither do i see the full path when i do an alt f9 otherwise , though , it will update when i choose the edit data command on the right click menu but , if i paste it through the paste special dialog box , choosing paste link and microsoft excel chart object , i do see the update command on the right click menu and i can see the path if i do an alt f9 any idea what i'm doing incorrectly or misunderstanding \? \( the purpose of being able to see the path is that , later on , when i want to use another workbook with the same graphics , all i need to do is an alt f9 and search and replace then i can do an update and all graphics are updated \) thanks again rich __eou__	User
FD_FQ	daniel below are screenshots both screenshots are the same dialog box , but show the different paste methods highlighted i'm not sure why the results are different when it appears that i'm linking 2 different ways thank you __eou__	User
PA	hi rich , to link or embed an excel worksheet in word , there are three ways to copy objects the last two are known as object linking and embedding \( ole \) the main differences between linked objects and embedded objects are where the data is stored and how you can update the data after it s inserted in your presentation when a chart is embed using microsoft excel chart objects , it will retain their excel characteristics and when they are embedded into word and then edited , excel will be the editor use destination theme link data , this is the default paste option \( ctrl v \) it keeps the chart linked to the original workbook to update the chart automatically , change the data in the original workbook you also can click chart tools design refresh data thanks , nedaniel __eou__	Agent
PF	thank you daniel until now , i thought that linking would look and act exactly the same , regardless of how the object was inserted , provided linking was used now i see that there is a difference and i can see what the difference is thank you again rich __eou__	User

OQ	i am formatting a paperback for amazon kdp paperback using word 2016 windows 10 i am using roman numerals for the first part of the book \( up until the introduction \) , and then starting at the introduction i switch to arabic numerals however , the page that has the section break is completely missing a page number i wish it to conclude the roman numerals please tell me what i am doing wrong and how i may remedy this problem \? thanks very much __eou__	User
IR_PA	what type of section break did you insert \? try a next page section break , or go to the second section of the document and on the layout tab of the page setup dialog , change the section start to new page if you cannot sort it out if you send me a copy of the document , referencing this thread in the covering email message , i will investigate the issue __eou__	Agent
PA	when you restart numbering at 1 , word will insist on making page 1 a recto \( right side \) page if the previous section ends on an odd page , word will insert a completely blank even \( verso , left side \) page between the sections even if you have inserted a next page break , word will treat it as an odd page break you will not see the blank page in print layout view but can see it in print preview if you display more than one page if the issue is that the previous section ends on an even page containing text but without a folio \( printed page number \) , then the problem could be in the location or type of section break , as juan suggests __eou__	Agent
FD_FQ	thank you very much , scott yes , you hit the nail on the head , my blank page \( without a page number \) is an even page please , do you know how this will display when i upload it to kdp paperback \? in other words , will an even number roman numeral appear , or will the entire page be simply blank \? i do not know for sure , but i do not think it is acceptable for a book to have a completely blank page without any page number i need to do something to get a roman numeral page number on that left side page thank you in advance for your time and advice __eou__	User

OQ	i'm on holiday so only have my surface rt and lumia win10 phone with me and need to re size some photographs so i can send them through my live email i was surprised to discover i could n't do this thru live mail as i used to , the help function in live email does n't suggest anything at all and i have searched on line but only find 3rd party products nothing from microsoft there has to be a way to resize my pictures on either my surface rt or win10 phone does any one know one \? __eou__	User
PA_PF	hey neil , you can still resize pictures with your live mail if you 're doing it from the live mail website \( now known as outlook com \) , you can click the picture button on the toolbar and select the picture file you want to send once it shows in the email , click the button on the picture and click resize and you can pick the size there 's other ways , of course \( probably over 100 \) for example , you could use the built in microsoft paint you 'd open the picture file , then click the resize button on the toolbar when you have it the size you like , just press save \( or save as if you want a make another copy without modifying the original \) or you could download one of the photo editing apps in the app store adobe has several , but there 's dozens of choices but i prefer to use the easy , built in options __eou__	Agent
FD	thanks for the very prompt reply ! however , i do n't think i have a picture button on my toolbar \( i'm using my surface rt now \) i 've clicked the ' ' more commands button and do n't see it there either i must be doing something dumb ! __eou__	User
PA	it 's only there if you are using your live mail from the website in your web browser __eou__	Agent
FD	hmmm i'm using live mail from the website in my browser \( explorer \) on the rt but still do n't see it \? __eou__	User
PA	hmm , perhaps your live mail account has n't made the switch to the new style yet \( they 're upgrading everyone \) here 's what it would look like if you 're on the new style already __eou__	Agent
FD_FQ	yes i have that button and it 's the 'in line' button it 's same as the screen you helpfully sent me the 'size' options when i load a new picture are small , best fit and original when i select 'small' it physically reduces the dimensions of the picture do you know if this also reduces the mb size of the picture or whether the file size is retained \? this all started when an email i sent to my son was bumped because the file size was too large i'm sure microsoft used to have a method of reducing file size of photo 's i 'd rather use a ms one but ca n't even find a 3rd party one that runs on the rt or win10 phone platform do you know of one \? __eou__	User
PA	the built in paint program would definitely do it without installing anything i use it myself because i use a huge variety of comptuers \( and re install operating systems so much \) that i want to use whatever exists instead of worrying about if the comptuer i'm using at the moment has the same other programs installed or not but you do n't even have to bother , because when you use the small option , it does reduce the actual mb file size of the picture also , not just the physical size __eou__	Agent

FQ	i am also getting this error , but via wpx8 , and printerserver180 exe i solved this , at least temporarily , by closing wp , going to taksmanager , finding a background process called print server \( 32 bit \) , and ending that task i also ended another task right next to it , print driver host for applications there may be more than one instance of these , i ended them all i then went to the wp installation directory where i found the program printserver180 exe in the subdirectory corelwordperfect office x8programs i then started it up up using run as administrator on the right click menu i then restarted wpx8 , and printed a document , and it printed without the error note that not all of these steps may be necessary , and that an automatic startup of that program might be configured if no other solution presents itself __eou__	Agent

OQ	i submitted a url to the bing index it shows up in the search , but when i click on it , i get this message not acceptable ! an appropriate representation of the requested resource could not be found on this server this error was generated by mod security what could be the problem \? the search query i'm using is this beauty spa salon responsive javascript template 48623 the results look like this trobaz com javascript beauty spa salon responsive template 48623 thank you __eou__	User
FD_PA	fwiw , i performed that search with the bing search engine and had no trouble clicking through the second entry \( trobaz com javascript beauty spa salon responsive template 48623 \) in any event , the error you are receiving seems to be coming from the apache web server that site is hosted on , not the bing search engine i would recommend that you search the help forums in your web hosting company 's support site for clues on how to tailor the mod security and secfilterengine configuration to avoid the error __eou__	Agent
FD_PF	this is really weird i tried soon after i read your response and got the same error then i tried google , then yahoo , then bing \( at msn com \) , then at bing com now it seems to be working fine i do n't have a clue thanks for your prompt response __eou__	User
PA	i'm glad to hear that your situation was resolved although i am as mystified as you as to what corrected the rogue behavior perhaps your web hosting company changed some defaults perhaps it was simply a process of negotiation with their apache web server in any event , i'm glad you have come to a satisfactory conclusion __eou__	Agent
FD_PF	strange indeed ! i entered the terms javascript popup in the add new plugins search field in my updated wordpress install hosted on bluehost , got a list of results , and clicked to see the details of one , and got this message in the resulting popup when i reloaded the page , all i got was text stripped of css i removed javascript from the url so it would just search for popup , and it worked i have a feeling the term javascript is causing issues with mod security it 's not like the word javascript is actually a threat , though very odd __eou__	Agent

FD_RQ	pmfji i hope melvin zheng 's suggestion resolves the issue for you , but something still does n't sound right \) no matter what i do it 's impossible to have that list disappear it defaults to a minimum of 8 rows even when no animation effects are applied cannot be made any shorter than that there is no option to completely collapse the list area as shown in your screen shot the screen shot also shows that the green play all as well as the delete \( red \) buttons are missing from the animations pane those controls are not components of the list area , itself please go to powerpoint about powerpoint reply with your version license info __eou__	Agent
NF	melvin is nuts there 's no dot above effect options here 's a screenshot for proof you must select an object that has animation to make the reorder arrows become active btw you can drag the word animations to the left and turn the panel into a floating palette __eou__	Agent
FD_NF	well , s he 's not completely nuts , courtneymy , but the 'dot' is below the bottom edge of the list it can be used to increase the list height to expose more rows if necessary , but its height cannot be decreased to display fewer than 8 rows the op 's list is n't showing at all nor are the controls that should appear above the list , although the dot is there the point is that even if no animations are applied or selected , the animation pane list should default to at least 8 rows tall __eou__	Agent

IR	hi jeffrey mcvicker , good day ! local call to mobile and landlines means that the number you will be calling is covered on the calling plan that you purchase just to clarify if i m getting your concern correctly , you mean that you and your wife purchased united kingdom 400 minutes mobiles and landlines 1 month for your respective accounts and you would like to purchase same subscription for your daughter \? if so , yes , you may do so please be advised that sharing of subscription is not recommended as it violates the fair usage policy thank you ! marites p skype community moderator __eou__	Agent
FD_PA	hi , jeffrey mcvicker to explain a different way , skype call subscriptions cannot be shared amongst several skype accountholders a subscription is dedicated to the account that the subscription was purchased on there is no way to share a single subscription will it cover my three cell phones with verizon \? my wife , daughter , and i have separate skype accounts , however we are bundled together with verizon therefore , the answer to your original question is , no that your verizon wireless plan includes three numbers is not related to , and has no connection with , any skype accounts skype does not have a friends and family feature , whereby rate plans , credit , text messaging , and call minutes can be shared in an account structure such as you , your wife , and daughter have in place with verizon some of the cellular service providers offer this , however skype subscriptions , credit , and paid features have always been and continue to be set up for purchase and use on only one account the account used to purchase the subscription , paid feature , or credit regards , elaine __eou__	Agent

PA	hi rachel , to burn a powerpoint presentation with the video files links , you may use some third party solutions we welcome some community members to share some suggestions on this issue for your reference http www pptfaq com faq00155 sounds movies don t play images disappear or links break when i move or email a presentation htm disclaimer microsoft provides no assurances and or warranties , implied or otherwise , and is not responsible for the information you receive from the third party linked sites or any support related to technology moreover , you can update your office applications to office 2016 for mac for better user experience thanks , cliffjessica __eou__	Agent
FD_PA	depending on what you need to do , the link jessica provided might or might not be useful if you 're trying to create a dvd to play in a dvd player tv as a movie , then this wo n't work , at least not directly movies ca n't have links the way ppt files can you could use a program like windows live movie maker or similar to create a kind of table of contents menu page for a dvd that includes links to your various movies and to a movie created from your ppt file if you 're trying to create a dvd of your ppt pptx ppsx file , one that will play in the copy of powerpoint installed on a computer , then the link in cliffjessica 's reply is just the medicine you need , i think __eou__	Agent

OQ	hi everyone , if you see in the picture that i posted there are multiple sheets with abbreviated team names \( chel , spurs , arsena \) and then theres a sheet 1 where i want to store specific data from the team name sheets in cells x25 y25 of the picture you will see aaron ramsey and a number \( 7 38 \) this is the highest rating of the table in x1 y23 then there is a table in cells aa1 ab23 this is the top goal scorer for that specific team this is how all of the sheets are within the project , and in sheet 1 i want all of the top goal scorers and highest rated players from each team to be displayed in sheet 1 also , it must be automated so if the top goalscorer changes in one sheet for example in aresena sheet it changes from alexandre to mesuit ozil then in sheet 1 it must also change to mesuit ozil please let me know and thank you in advance __eou__	User
PA	my \( simplistic \) take would be to use an index match assuming row 1 is formatting you could have row 2 be a2 arsenal , b2 index \( arsena ! x y , match \( max \( arsena ! y y \) , arsena ! e e , 0 \) , 1 \) c2 index \( arsena ! x y , match \( max \( arsena ! y y \) , arsena ! y y , 0 \) , 2 \) then for the next row do the same but with the name of the next tab swapped as appropriate if you are curious what is going on under the hood first i find the max number in the data column \( y \) , and then use match to find out how far down the column that value is i then use the index to pull the name next to that column a vlookup ca n't look left , but a combination of index and match can thanks , aaron __eou__	Agent
PA	hi , try this 1 in sheet1 , list down all team names starting from cell a2 and going all the way downwards ensure that the spellings here match the spellings of your tab names 2 in cell b2 , enter this formula and copy down indirect \( ' a2 ' ! x25 \) repeat step 2 for bring over data from other cells as well just change the reference to y25 etc __eou__	Agent
RQ	john , that is a cool solution , but did you catch the op 's request to have the sheet update to the largest value on the original sheet \? so ify27 becomes larger than y25 , he would want x27 and y 27 to display , not x25 and y25 i 'd love to see your solution updated for that though ! thanks , aaron __eou__	Agent

OQ	edge is my favourite browser but i'm disappointed that i ca n't use it on my windows 7 and 8 1 machines are there any plans to create a downloadable version of edge that can be installed on windows 7 and windows 8 1 \? edge will never have many users if they do n't make it available on all windows operating systems that are still supported by ms moved from \( windows apps on windows 10 microsoft edge pc \) __eou__	User
PA	hi , when edge was introduced for the first time , i was one of the hopefuls that one day microsoft edge would somehow be released for windows 7 or windows 8 and 8 1 as well unfortunately , since the edge browser is a built in application on the new universal windows platform , it would n't be possible to install edge on windows 7 we suggest though that you relay this great idea to our developers via our feedback hub so they can look into this , and possibly consider the idea in the future feel free to contact us if you need further assistance with windows __eou__	Agent
FD_NF	thanks for the reply i realise they do this to try to persuade people to upgrade to windows 10 while i do have a windows 10 licence for both my win 7 and win 8 1 laptops from that free upgrade offer i have found that neither laptop is 100 compatible with windows 10 there is no full compatible video driver available for the windows 7 laptop and the windows 8 laptop ca n't access wifi channel 13 and has poor sound quality when using windows 10 because of this i find it unfair that microsoft expects you to upgrade to windows 10 to get edge i have also found that feedback app in windows 10 to be useless because i and many other people have reported the graphics driver problem that effects older ati radeon mobility graphics card and have been totally ignored __eou__	User

OQ	would i need to use all three of these match types or are they all the same because there are no spaces northdakotamaps northdakotamaps northdakotamaps thanks mark __eou__	User
PA	hi , julie ! thank you for your question , and happy saturday ! if you were to use all three match types with that keyword , the system would have some conflict deciding on what to serve generally speaking , the system usually goes for the most exact specific match to the query , but there have been quite a few times where the system does n't display an ad because of the multiple match type conflict therefore , it would be in your best interests to decide on 1 or 2 match types instead of all 3 now , choosing the right match type depends on your advertising goal if you are looking for as much traffic as possible , even if the query may not be 100 what you are advertising , i would select the broad match type if your objective is to draw towards a certain user , but do n't want to limit the keyword too much , then select the phrase match type but , if you only want your ad to serve if a user types in your keyword exactly , with nothing else in the query , your best option is exact match you can find out more about match types in the following links what are keyword match types , and how do i use them \? using broad match and broad match modifier keyword match options if you have any other questions or concerns about this , feel free to reply to this response , chat in , or contact our support team for your region hope this helps ! have an awesome day ! __eou__	Agent
PA	hi mark , shortest answer to your question single word broad match phrase match keyword will work in a similar manner adding in exact match means search term will trigger when exactly someone is searching for northdakotamaps with no additional words before and after so if you want to add single word keyword as mentioned in your question imo , you can add in broad and exact hope that makes sense ! thanks stephanie __eou__	Agent

CQ_FQ	thanks for your reply about mulitple video screens i understand that this is not an option that skype itself offers , but are you aware of any software that enables this , such as manycams \? \( i know that many cams works for broadcasters not watchers \) so currently there is no way possible to watch more than one video stream over skype at a time \? i do know that you can open skype mulitple times through your browser if you have more than one browser , so do you know if its possible to watch two different video streams at a time this way \? __eou__	User

IR	hi amanda , thanks for sharing with us the video from the video , i saw you use a specific document does it mean the issue can be reproduced easier with this file or the issue is only related to this kind of file \? could you attach that file via replying to my private message \? meanwhile , for that two macs which can reproduce this issue , do they use multiple monitor \? regards , timapril __eou__	Agent
FD	hello april , yes , i did use a specific document , but i also indicated in my reply how to reproduce the issue without that file in other words , it is not file specific please try the following on your end and see if you can reproduce as i wrote , i have reproduced this issue on two macs running el capitan , and one running sierra no , i am sorry , as i wrote i cannot attach the file , for confidentiality reasons , but the problem is quite easy to reproduce as shown above as for multiple monitors , apparently it does not matter the issue occurs even on one monitor jeff amanda __eou__	User
IR_PA	hi amanda , thanks for your updates i tested with powerpoint for mac 15 34 on sierra 10 12 5 the issue does n't occur i 'd like to confirm do you use some specific add ins in powerpoint for mac \? please check if the issue occurs with below options option1 access mac safe mode option2 create a new account for mac disclaimer microsoft provides no assurances and or warranties , implied or otherwise , and is not responsible for the information you receive from the third party linked sites or any support related to technology let us know some updates when you have time regards , timapril __eou__	Agent
FD	dear april , many thanks for your quick replies , and for your interest in helping to identify the problem i tried booting in safe mode , and then started up each helper app that typically runs in the background , one by one , to see if i could find any culprits good news ! i identified that whenever moom \( the os x window management software developed by many tricks \) was running in the background , this powerpoint crashing issue when switching between normal and notes page views would occur when i quit moom and attempt the same steps in powerpoint , the problem does not occur i'm never had issues with powerpoint and moom like this before , but apparently something has changed during their upgrade cycles , causing a dependency on common processes \( \? \) to fail it seems strange to me that a window management app with apparently no dependencies on powerpoint would cause issues like this when the powerpoint view is changed , but quitting moom does solve the problem on all of my machines , two running el capitan \( 10 11 6 \) and one running sierra i suppose the next step is to report this to many tricks but i also wonder if this is not a powerpoint issue as well at any rate , thanks very much for helping me to track down the problematic process safe boot mode and a little sleuthing did the trick ! now i need to find an alternative for moom that wo n't interfere with powerpoint jeffamanda __eou__	User
PA	hi amanda , thanks for sharing with us these updates it will also help other users who use the same application and encounter this issue as you mentioned , powerpoint itself works well when moom is running at background , the issue occurs in this situation , i suggest you contact moom support if you want to further investigation this issue regards , timapril __eou__	Agent

OQ	hi , i have an excel form that populates the date entered into a1 , into b1 using the following formula \( if \( len \( a1 \) , a1 , \) a1 has data validation applied that requires it to be a date my problem is that when a non date is entered into a1 \( e g 6548 \) , i get the error message for a1 , but b1 extrapolates the number into what it thinks is the date \( e g 12 4 1917 \) is there a way to have it not show a result in b1 if a1 results in an error for the data validation check \? thanks , scott __eou__	User
IR_PA	the length function for date depends on your date range what is your minimum date in that sheet \? because you have used len function which returns 4 or 5 or something due to excel reads date as number every new day excel adds 1 with last days number the 1 jan 1900 date excel reads as 1 and day after day it adding 1 it reads your 12 apr 1917 date as 6312 so in my opinion is , do not use len \( \) to get the date , use date \( \) , that is why i 've asked you what is the minimum date i'm sue that , your data validation has set a minimum date just check it from data data validation settings date then , you can use date \( \) or datevalue \( \) or simple if funcion you also have to share some sample data here and expected result to get your answer \) __eou__	Agent
NF	cody , with all due respect , but that goes into a completely wrong direction date \( \) is used to create a date value from components for year , month and day datevalue \( \) is used to create a datevalue from a text string none of these functions can be used to check if a cell contains a date spinazroger1 , is your data validation set up so that the user gets a warning and is still allowed to enter text into the date cell \? if so , consider configuring the data validation that only valid entries are allowed this can be done by setting the data validation style to stop on the error alert tab , as shown in the screenshot with this setting , only dates can be entered into the cell and text wo n't be allowed if , however , for some reason you do want to allow text as well , but you only want to show the result in b1 if the data entered in a1 is a date , then you can check with isnumber \( \) instead of len \( \) in your if statement of course , since all dates are stored as numbers internally , the user could just type in a number , and if that number falls within the date range you allowed in the data validation settings , then the isnumber function would also return true __eou__	Agent
FD	thanks cody i used len not to get the date , but only to check if there is something in the cell a1 if there is a date value entered into a1 , then it should populate what 's in a1 into b1 otherwise , it should populate nothing will the date \( \) function you suggest to replace len work in this way \? __eou__	User
FD_FQ	here is an example of my problem since the date is before today 's date , it errors out based on the data validation \( which requires it to be later than today 's date \) however , it still displays this invalid date in b2 i would like to prevent this from happening i am not seeing an option to attach an example file per your request , so included this snipit thanks again for your help __eou__	User

PA	hi , thank you so much for posting your query on this forum from the issue description , i understand that you have set your browser homepage as bing com , however , when you sign out from your outlook com email account , it redirects automatically to the msn website and would like to know if you can change any settings so that it goes to the bing website the outlook com website is designed in such a way that it redirects automatically to the msn website whenever the user logs out from the outlook com email account this behavior cannot be changed by changing any settings on the computer this is by the website design for example , if you have a yahoomail account and when you logs out your account , it takes you to the website us yahoo com it does not connect to your homepage or any other websites this is how the yahoo website is designed however , if you want to access the bing website , you just need to close the current session of the browser and then open a new browser session on the computer and that would connect you to the bing website automatically __eou__	Agent

FQ	just noticed you 'd responded to this what that typically means is that the 6 key on your keyboard appears to the system as pressed , possibly either stuck in the down position or somehow shorted by something that dropped into the area below the keys most often today this will be due to a liquid spill of something containing sugar or syrup , since this contains enough electrical conductivity to make the key appear to be pressed or otherwise simply cause the key to stick in a pressed position as it slowly dries both the laptop i'm writing this on and the previous one had this happen at least once with lemonade , which eventually caused the sticky keys problem i described above the older model was so bad i ordered a replacement from dell and replaced it myself , fortunately at a cost of only 29 plus shipping on this more expensive backlit laptop , i had the time to disassemble and remove the keyboard first , then used clean running water for several minutes to thoroughly flush out the spilled liquid , dry it completely using first a towel and then leaving it overnight to air dry one key does still occasionally stick slightly in humid weather , making an audible squishing sound , but not enough to truly cause more than minor annoyance it 's possible the problem is just something metal under the keys , but most laptops today do n't allow for this , so that 's why i 'd suspect a liquid spill as most likely erika __eou__	Agent

FQ	i use my windows pc to locate an address on bing maps , and get the bird 's eye view i click share to obtain , then copy and paste the link into an email i send the email to someone if the recipient opens the link on a pc , the bird 's eye view is properly displayed if the recipient opens the link on an android phone , they do not get the birds 's eye view instead they get a road map view i have tested this on android 4 0 4 and on android 6 01 , with the same result this would be a useful feature , if it worked i am able to send google street view links , which open properly for people , but not bing bird 's eye view links not sure if this works on apple ios am i doing something wrong \? does anyone have an experience with this \? is anyone using android able to open a link to bird 's eye view of an address , and have it display the bird 's eye view properly on the android device \? __eou__	User
PA	hi , thank you for posting your query on microsoft community if i understand you correctly you are willing to open bing bird 's eye view links on android phone as you have mentioned that bing bird 's eye view links open on other windows pc when you send them through your email but when the same bing bird 's eye view links open on android phone it get open in a road map view this is just a compatibility issue as windows and android are different operating system as you have mentioned that you are able to open google street view links on android phone this is because android os if from google you are right that if this would be added then it will be very useful hope i was able to answer your query do feel free to post on the forum if you have any more concern related to windows we will be happy to assist you again regards , __eou__	Agent

OQ	consider a scatter chart with multiple traces i used to be able to click on a single trace and then use the arrow keys to move up or don through the traces this seems to have stopped working this also prevent me from quick adding another trace by copying the series \( \) formula and changing the series number to the next number after the number of traces in the chart how can i get this behavior back \? thanks , john __eou__	User
PA	i used to be able to click on a single trace and then use the arrow keys to move up or don through the traces this seems to have stopped working hold down ctrl while tapping the arrow key this also prevent me from quick adding another trace by copying the series \( \) formula and changing the series number to the next number after the number of traces in the chart this was never the best way to add another data series right click chart open select data click add button and fill in the simple dialog best wishes __eou__	Agent
PA	op in my environment , i am able to click on a single trace series and then hold down the ctrl key and use the up and down arrow keys to move up or down through the traces series once i go beyond the listing of traces series via ctrl up down , i ca n't necessarily go back to them , in which case sometimes ctrl left right seems to help me get back to them __eou__	Agent
NF	ctrl arrow key does work , but it is very annoying that this changed why would i want to hold another key down while i tap another key , especially when i could previously just tap the other key \? it 's a backwards step in terms of accessibility ease of use i hope this change gets reverted by microsoft __eou__	Agent

OQ	i have a comma in my skype user name with the latest version of skype , as of a few days ago , i cannot sign in on my iphone because i cannot locate the comma in the key pad \( regular , numeric or symbol \) so , how do i sign in on my iphone \? is there a special key stroke pattern to get a comma \? thanks ken __eou__	User
PA	hello brian , welcome to skype community ! it 's unusual that you are not seeing a comma on your keyboard when signing in as it is one of the most commonly used characters if you have changed your keyboard settings , i suggest that you revert it to the default one alternatively , you may find a comma online or from a text message and copy it then , paste it on the log in page of the skype app i hope the information above helps regards , __eou__	Agent
CQ_FD	i agree that it is unusual that i see no comma but please note , this lack of a comma on the sign in keyboard only occurred after the recent update for the two years prior to this , i had no problem locating a comma and logging in previous to that , i had a blackberry with hard keys so the situation was different i ultimately did log in by going to another application which presented the full keyboard , write my login name , copy the text and then paste it into the skype login screen once logged in , the application presented the full keyboard with the comma and all the other characters prior to getting the idea to copy paste , i went to the local microsoft store \( the valley fair shopping mall in san jose california \) and i talked to one of the employees at the store hey , skype is a microsoft product after all the employee was stumped as well and then went to consult one of the service techs after consulting the service tech , he came back telling me that this same situation occurs on the samsung phone as well \( i guess that the service tech had a samsung \) that is when i went across the aisle to the apple store \( yes , it is really located just across the aisle \) and while looking for an after market external keyoard i got the copy paste idea i did try working with my keyboard preferences but to no avail i do believe that the specific keyboard that is presented to the user is ultimately determined by the app and , in the recent update , some coder at microsoft overlooked an important detail about the keyboard __eou__	User
PA	hi brian , thank you for your prompt response if you have n't tried , i hope you can give a try to press and hold the period from your keyboard and let 's see if it will help in making the comma show up when signing in if the problem persists , please let me know by responding to this thread regards , __eou__	Agent

PA	hello this is michael the first screenshot you provided shows cloud drives i would remove those as that data is also in the cloud and on your computer onedrive and dropbox files should be synced to the cloud so those do not need to be put on a usb normally i would concentrate on backing up what is important to you documents , pictures , music , favorites some of those folders are not necessary to backup in that screenshot any folder that has a period in front \( android \) is configuration information for devices like your mobile device that do not necessarily need to backed up my advice is to keep it simple find what is the most important and include only those in your backup i personally use onedrive as my backup it will depend on how much space is in your onedrive or dropbox and how much your backing up hope that helps __eou__	Agent

CQ_FD	thanks for the reply stephanie , my main query was for an alternate to emf format , because even opensource programs like apache office has multiple vector graphic format support \( including the original svg \) , and since microsoft is such a giant in computer programs , especially ms office word is such an advanced wysiwyg word processing engine , i naturally assumed that it must have vector format that is more compatible with vector designing softwares like illustrator and inkscape as for dedicated emf graphic designing software , i have tried to search for it but could not find it , and i was hoping that somebody in ms community might help me out , certainly i am not the only one having this problem regards , uzairamber __eou__	User
PA	any software that produces emf will likely have the same kinds of problems emf wmf graphics are fairly primitive and do n't include the ability to handle things like gradient fills , soft edges shadows and the like instead , programs that export emf have to perform workarounds to preserve a gradient , they 'll export gazillions of rectangles or polygons that , together , look like a single gradient filled shape editing these \? a nightmare ! i would suggest this workflow draw your graphics in any program that works well for you , but stick with simple shapes and lines do n't do any gradient fills or other fancy effects export as emf , import the emf into powerpoint , ungroup it and then apply any effects you like to the shapes once you do this , the graphic will be in native ms office format you can copy paste it from ppt to word and it should retain all of its characteristics you might , in fact , be able to import the emf directly into word , ungroup and apply effects there since ppt is the tool i use most often , i 'd rather work there and then copy to word , but if going directly to word works well for you , leave ppt out of the equation entirely __eou__	Agent
FD_PF	hi christy , thanks for the reply the workaround you suggested was really helpful could you clarify one point for me will i be able to perform clippings in powerpoint what i mean from clipping is that it acts similar to cropping image , but with much more control \( and dynamic \) one can define a shape to extracted from the original image and crop every thing else \( for example , the image you made is a rectangular vector image and you just want the circular image of a part , you can clip that image by drawing a circle over the part you wish to extract , then select both the image and the circle , and apply clipping effect \) regards , uzairamber __eou__	User
PA	ppt does n't have a clipping function in quite the same sense that , say , corel draw and probably adobe illustrator do you ca n't define a clipping path , use it to clip another shape or shapes , and later adjust the clipping path to hide or reveal more of the clipped graphics but you can use the merge shapes command on the format insert shapes area to do a one time clip \( ie , you can use intersect to combine an image , for example with a shape and end up with the image clipped to the shape boundaries as a new shape that replaces the original shapes \) __eou__	Agent
GG	thanks for the answer , christy i 'll try out your tips , and see how it goes if its too much of a hassle , maybe i 'll switch to apache openoffice it supports the svg format , and the only thing i 'll regret would be losing a nice ui of ms office __eou__	User
PA	hi ! i think the workaround is a good idea if you have plenty of time and not a lot of graphics i'm working on a major document project requiring close to 600 graphics in the next month so this workaround is not going to be useful and would actually double the workload not to mention would probably be better if \( ugh \) i just create originally in powerpoint \( not fond of \) i'm currently using illustrator 2017 on a windows 10 system the requirements say they want the word document in 2010 format and a pdf that is 100 editable including the graphics i'm saving out vector art in emf format but they look really really bad lines get jacked , curves get pixelated etc yes we 're using bevels and some gradients \( only as necessary \) we 're also getting odd artifacts on the emf \( white borders for no apparent reason \) that are confusing also noted that we cannot open emf files in photoshop for quick trims \( of those white borders \) \( grrrr \) any help at all on suggesting how we get vector ai files exported out for insertion into word and subsequent editable pdf formatting would be greatly appreciated since i'm still in the early production stages but am facing a total sunami of art in the next week or so eeek ! \) __eou__	Agent
CQ_PA	i'm not an ai user but in the past i 've seen the problem with curves and such getting pixelated \( actually , they 're being rendered as a series of short lines , not getting pixelated , but the effect is similar \) the fix there seems to be to make the shapes as big as possible in ai before exporting to emf or at least this is how it used to work apparently ai breaks curves into xx segments per point or inch or whatever the bigger you make the graphic , the more segments you get , so the smoother the line as far as gradients , my experience has been that you 're better off leaving things flat colored in ai then ungrouping and applying gradients in ppt otherwise , the gradient is liable to turn into a skillion individual shapes , making editing a nightmare as to the white borders , not sure , but quite often \( i 'd say always , in my experience \) emfs include a background object ungroup the emf after inserting it into ppt , select the b g object , delete it , then regroup the remaining shapes i ca n't really say what might help to make the pdf editable it 'd depend on what tools are used and what type of editing is needed the above suggestions will probably help , at least somewhat but ca n't ai save directly to pdf \? why go through word ppt at all \? __eou__	Agent

OQ	i have a table of data it is several hundred rows i show the min , max and mean of a particular column is there a way , in addition to getting the answer , to highlight \( different color or background \) where it is in the column \? it would save time trying to find it thanks __eou__	User
PA	conditional formatting highlight cell rules equal to in the box that opens up , put the cell reference of the cell with your min max mean displayed so if you have your min in e42 and your max in e44 , you would put e42 in your condition , set highlight to red , then do it again and put e44 in your condition and set highlight to yellow , etc i just verified that conditional formatting can display different formats for different rules hope it helps , aaron __eou__	Agent
FD_FQ	aaron , thank you for your reply however , apparently i was not clear in what i am trying to do your solution does highlight the number in the max or min cell what i would like to do \( if possible \) is highlight the answer in the data column where it appears for example , if the min is 324 i would like that number highlighted in the data table so it wo n't be hard to find __eou__	User
PA	i think aaron means , in the cells in the column with numbers , add three conditional formatting rules to each cell you can create the rules in one cell and then copy paste special formats to the other cells in the column one rule checks if the cell 's value is equal to the cell that contains the min of the column and applies the color the second rule checks if the cell 's value is equal to the cell that contains the max of the column and applies that color the third does the same for the average so only two to three cells would be colored in the column of numbers __eou__	Agent
CQ_FQ	what cells did you apply the conditional formatting to \? if you did n't apply the formatting to the area you want to have highlighted , it wo n't highlight that area thanks , aaron __eou__	Agent
PF	yes , it should have been obvious to me it even took me a bit to reference the max and min cells correctly __eou__	User

PA	if a graphic is wrapped , word automatically creates the caption in a text box if the graphic is in line with text , the caption is ordinary paragraph text if the graphics in question are not wrapped , then obviously the text boxes are unneeded in older versions of word , there was an option to convert the text box to a frame , and you could then select remove frame in the format frame dialog in word 2010 , i think you 'll just have to cut the text from the text box , paste it into a new paragraph \( in the caption style \) , and then delete the empty text box it looks like you 've got just five to do , so perhaps that wo n't be too onerous __eou__	Agent

OQ	recently , i updated adobe reader on my mac when using excel or word now , i click preview \( print preview \) and it automatically goes to adobe reader 's preview and changes my file to a pdf i like using preview in the office for mac without the adobe reader hijacking it even when i quit adobe reader , it automatically opens when i click preview any way to change the settings to not allow adobe reader to hijack my preview \? __eou__	User
FD_PA	it was available yesterday in excel and word i did not do an update to excel or word , but i did update adobe reader , which hijacked my preview is there any way to prevent adobe reader from automatically hijacking preview \? the adobe reader preview is not near as accurate __eou__	User
PA	your file most certainly does not change to a pdf the files are untouched within the application however , neither app will display a preview within the application instead , the print preview command uses macosx 's print open pdf in x function to display the preview this behavior has been standard since office 2008 __eou__	Agent
CQ_FD	i did not intentionally change anything , but i guess adobe reader changed my default preview settings i tried finder file get info command the preview just shows a picture of a house i do n't know how to change it or even interpret what the picture of the house means obviously , i am not the most advanced user out there again , i really appreciate you trying to help i just have no clue how to change the preview to the macosx default or something other than that i simply want to preview it as i have for years and do not want adobe reader to automatically open when i hit preview in excel thanks again ! __eou__	User
FD	i just realized that i had to highlight the excel file to do the finder file get info command when i did that , it showed microsoft excel as the application and showed xls in the preview area i am still confused why all my files open adobe reader when i hit preview and add the pdf extension this is a new development maybe it is something new with the most recent version of adobe reader the only option i can think of is to somehow get rid of adobe reader i have looked to try to change settings in both excel and adobe reader , but ca n't figure out how oh well still just as lost and on top of that , the printing does not even look the same because i am now printing from an adobe pdf file instead of an excel file it may not seem like hijacking to you , but that is the only term i can think of it forces me to go to adobe reader and change it to a pdf for viewing purposes thanks again __eou__	User
PA	choosing an xl file wo n't work when you choose xl 's file print preview , you 're not looking at an xl file any more , you 're looking at the output of osx 's print to pdf , in whatever viewer you have chosen as the default note that if you want adobe reader to be your default pdf viewer , you 'll have to live with print preview using reader , or else choose file print , and click the pdf button to choose open pdf in xxx __eou__	Agent

CQ	hi melissa thank you for the quick reply office 365 currently version 1707 is on my other computers so i can only guess that is what was on the computer with the problem the problem is not file specific if i click on an excel file in windows explorer it takes 30 seconds to start open if i have excel open but use windows explorer to find the file i is very quick if i open a file within excel it is very quick the problem lies within the ability to start excel from windows explorer and has nothing to do with the files my complaint was that the repair function completely deleted all my office apps ! ! ! i had to reinstall office 365 from scratch i am now on version 1708 and excel and files open quickly the advice to repair is wrong until the repair function is fixed advice to delete and reinstall office is correct but a nuisance i assume all the computers will automatically upgrade to version 1708 __eou__	User

PA	i have discovered an answer it is microsoft and bing with the issue i experimented with substituting the user agent in the browsers i tested several variations also tested the following so , the actual browser used does n't make a difference , just what browser it claims to be when communicating with bing it looks like microsoft and bing are browser sniffing opera and either purposefully or accidentally sending a different bing search webpage why am i not surprised \? for now i'm using the same user agent switching add ons i used for testing so i can function with bing search it is a work around that i should n't have to use __eou__	User

OQ	recently \( yesterday in fact \) , i reinstalled windows 10 home and everything seems to work great i am interested in learning a bit more about how the mail live tile should behave i have been unable to find anything on the inet with regards to the tile i can find documentation about how to use the various features of the win 10 mail app but , so far , i am unable to find anything which might explain normal behavior of the mail app live tile my goal , is to not conclude that something is broken , when in fact it is working as the documentation states thanks __eou__	User
PA	hello ray i'm misty , an 8 year microsoft windows mvp , here to help you under notifications in mail settings \( gear icon \) , have you enabled all of the choices \? then in windows 10 settings \( gear icon in start menu \) under system notifications , are notifications enabled for mail app \? if so then you 've done everything right , now we need microsoft windows 10 mail team to fix this i have reported it via mvp communications channel please open the feedback hub in start menu , sign in if necessary with your ms account , then search for mail tile not working to vote up the issue and add your comment if desired i will continue to track and advocate the issue __eou__	Agent
PF	that , was very nice of you to reply so quickly it sounds as if \( based on my reading of your post \) that i have everything enabled correctly \( a good thing \) by the way it 's not just the mail app tile that i am unable to find documentation for i'm having the same issue with the msn news , and store apps as well plenty of how to use documentation available but little or no mention of the tiles here 's why i ask i recently reinstalled windows 10 home and everything , as far as i know , is running perfectly i did notice however , that the live mail tile seems to behave a bit differently than i remember it \( before the reinstall \) ie used to be \( methinks \) if i had 10 unanswered emails , the number 10 would appear on the tile if an additional email arrived , 10 , would turn to 11 and it would stay at 11 , until i opened mail and clicked on one of the 11 never opened emails if i clicked on one \( of the emails to read it \) and then ended mail , the live tile would now say 10 i always thought that the number on the tile represented the number of unread emails in the in box but due to the lack of documentation on the tile , i could have simply made that up now \( after my reinstall of windows 10 \) , it seems to behave differently as a test , i sent myself a couple of emails from my phone the number on the mail tile changed to 2 \( good , so far \) if however , i left it that way for a period of time , the number 2 will disappear and be replaced by no number at all but if i open the mail app , there are indeed 2 unread emails \( from my phone \) so , before crying wolf \( or worrying that my reinstall of windows 10 went bad in some way \) , i thought i would try to locate and read how the mail live tile is supposed to behave maybe , it is behaving correctly and either my memory is faulty \( would n't be the first time \) or now that windows has been reloaded and updated , i find the win10 mail tile \( by design \) simply works differently and that okay with me i just would like to know how it is supposed to work hence my looking for documentation did i write that correctly \? yes yes , i think i did thanks once again for your time , response to my question about finding documentation i 'll continue my search and if i ever find any , i 'll do my best to update this post ray in wisconsin \) __eou__	User
FD_IR_PA	hello again ray i do n't know of any documentation from microsoft on this all i find are outdated tutorials laden with complaints , and persistent complaints in the forums i do n't remember ever getting a number on my tile , just the latest mail arriving if i expand the tile large enough to fit it i just had them a few minutes ago , now they 're gone all the others including msn money \( you need to download from store now \) and msn news \( you need to customize first \) work fine there was a bug for awhile last year which we reported that all notifications went away if you changed dpi please do voice your feedback on this in the feedback hub as the developers have to show they are responding to customer feedback there __eou__	Agent

FD_PA	hey there , ray ! while there is no documentation , i am thinking about creating a forum article here on the microsoft community that shows how these are supposed to behave , and explain what they are take mail for example any new mail you receive should appear on the tile , if you have turned live tile on it will flick between all of the new mail that has come in , giving you short snippets of the email and who it is from you will notice that it will have a number at the bottom right this is to list how many new notifications emails you have got i have some free time tomorrow , so i will write the article , as this seems to be something that is asked quite a lot hope this helps , regards , __eou__	Agent

OQ	we are using a large workbook with multiple sheets to capture similar and add new data \( different purposes \) there are 3 columns \( person 's name , agency , topic \) that we would like linked across 2 sheets and then be able to add , change or sort data in each one while maintaining the data integrity of the row dummy data example 1st sheet participants name agency topic comments priority contact snoopy doghouse animals smells funny 3 mickey disney mice catch 1 2nd sheet calendar name agency topic contacted status dates available snoopy doghouse animals yes arriving friday mickey disney mice no unknown i can link the first 3 columns , but if we add data to the others and then sort the 1st sheet , the data linked becomes mismatched with the data entered for each person on the 2nd sheet is there anyway to prevent this while allowing the data to be sorted \? thanks , lisa __eou__	User
PA	the value in a2 \( snoopy \) of the calendar sheet needs to be manually entered this can be done using a data validation list which refers to column a of the participants sheet columns b c in the calendar sheet need to be formulas like this in b2 vlookup \( a2 , participants ! a c , column \( participants ! b 1 \) , false \) in c2 vlookup \( a2 , participants ! a c , column \( participants ! c 1 \) , false \) that way if the participants sheet is sorted the calendar sheet will still look up the correct data hope this helps emily __eou__	Agent
FD	i will play with that and see how it works i was trying to work with vlookup , but did n't know about keeping the first column unlinked bad aspect is this is really large , so the name column could potentially have 10 , 000 entries thanks , lisa __eou__	User

FD	hi curtis , thank you for your answer sorry , no , there is no clickable pop out to restore them there is nothing but blank space i have edited my original post to include steps to reproduce the behavior i think it 's a bug of some kind after further investigation , it is most definitely a bug in the outline view icon that you can put on the quick access toolbar once you hit that icon , the thumbnail pane in the slide master view disappears , almost regardless of where and when you use the icon i have removed the troublesome icon from my quick access bar hours lost \( sigh \) i hope someone uses my contribution to fix the bug __eou__	User

FD	hi curtis , thank you for persisting and trying to reproduce my bug i know it was there because i could reproduce it at will i thought , maybe i should make them a movie to demonstrate it but decided against it because it was so obscure someone would have to use the outline icon on the qat , then click it while in slide master view i just deleted the icon and walked away after posting i had spent enough time on the problem but today , since you posted and were trying , i thought i would make a movie for you but i could not reproduce the problem by adding outline back to the qat now my behavior is the same as yours everything works as expected the only mysterious thing is that the outline icon now looks like the normal view icon , instead of the look it had before \( unless my memory is lying to me \) anyhow , removing and adding the outline icon to the qat has solved my problem , so i'm happy thank you again kevin __eou__	User

PA	it is doing that because every if field is in its own paragraph , and word still displays prints the paragraph mark if you want all the doubleyes doubleno values on one line , you can put all the if fields on a single line , e g if mergefield iscorrect 0 mergefield doubleyes1 if mergefield iscorrect 0 mergefield doubleyes2 if mergefield iscorrect 0 mergefield doubleyes3 etc if mergefield iscorrect 1 mergefield doubleno1 if mergefield iscorrect 1 mergefield doubleno2 if mergefield iscorrect 1 mergefield doubleno3 etc \( if you need the values to be separate , put spaces or whatever between the if fields \) in this case , you could perhaps simplify it by doing one test for each value of iscorrect if mergefield iscorrect 0 mergefield doubleyes1 mergefield doubleyes2 mergefield doubleyes3 etc if mergefield iscorrect 1 mergefield doubleno1 mergefield doubleno2 mergefield doubleno3 etc sometimes it is hard to read lots of fields on a single line , but if you put new paragraphs inside the if field braces , they wil not appear in the output \( but they will cause the display to change quite radically whenever you switch between field code view and field results view \) e g if mergefield iscorrect 0 mergefield doubleyes1 mergefield doubleyes2 mergefield doubleyes3 etc if mergefield iscorrect 1 mergefield doubleno1 mergefield doubleno2 mergefield doubleno3 etc __eou__	Agent

FD_PA	sounds like your using a version of office that is either a trial version or you have multiple installations of the same office program installed on the same pc click on the windows button \( top left \) of any of the applications and it will bring up your program properties have a look if the product has been activated and if it has n't then you will need to run through the activation process before full functionality is restored to your applications hope this makes sense __eou__	Agent

OQ	as a word for mac 2016 user i recently upgraded to the new high sierra os unfortunately it is raising havoc with my fonts here is the problem as a writer i have used times new roman as my default font for years i have always used it with curly quotes as that is what my editors prefer recently , a strange thing has been happening with times new roman curly quotes and some other punctuation marks instead of producing them in times , the document automatically changes the quotation mark font to helvetica that then changes the following text to helvetica as well if i turn off curly quotes and use only straight quotes the problem goes away as an experiment i tried using other serif fonts with curly quotes they also automatically convert to helvetica with one exception garamond this quotation mark issue raised havoc with my 700 page book manuscript , causing me to have to go through it line by line to fix the quotes search and replace does not really help since when it adds helvetica it converts blocks of text after that right now as i stare at a deadline , my only option is to convert the entire manuscript to garamond and forget any idea of ever using times again that is not an acceptable solution s0 how do i get times new roman to work with curly quotes \? i have wasted too many hours trying to find a solution to this and have found nothing all instances i have found have essentially given up and just quit using times given that the issue began with the switch to high sierra i am wondering if this is an apple issue \? or , is microsoft not prepared to deal with high sierra \? thanks for listening __eou__	User

OQ	hi , i recently replaced a broken nokia 920 windows mobile 8 with another , used 920 to hold me over until my at t contract is up and i can upgrade more affordably the only problem with switching to the new phone is that all my bing health and fitness app gps tracker history is gone , which is weird because when i set up the app \( on both the old phone and the new phone \) , i set it to connect to my windows live account \( or whatever that 's called these days \) and thought the data was stored on the cloud somewhere , not my phone but , when i view the gps tracker history on the new phone , it says , no workouts to show what happened to my history and how can i get it back \? __eou__	User
OQ	hi , i believe the information is stored in the cloud and should be accessible synced to the new phone using a removable storage card you can move the data from the first phone to the media card , and then simply put the card in the second phone to access the data if the media cards are of a different format , you may be able to buy a card reader for your computer , move the data from the first phone to the computer , then move it to the media card for the second phone ask your mobile service provider if they provide a backup service contact data look for infrared ports \( ip \) on the phones many pda style phones have them this feature enables you to set the phones next to one another and literally beam data from one phone to the other check if the phones have mini usb ports if so , you may be able to connect the phones and transfer data that way email the data files from one phone to the other if the phones have email capabilities ehow com __eou__	Agent
PA	thanks , carolyn here 's what i did 1 sign up for microsoft health vault 2 go to the healthvault tab page of the bing health fitness app settings , and connect to healthvault there 3 all data from the old phone will be stored on the cloud 4 refresh the healthvault web site on your desktop or restart your phone to see all your exercises sync 'd in the gps tracker and online additional info if helpful the bing health fitness app data is not saved locally on the phone , so most of the suggestions in smittychat 's response above did n't work \( sorry \) here 's where the confusion stems when you open the health fitness app , if you go to the bottom right and expand the menu options , the app gives you the option to connect to microsoft account it 's not clear to me where the data goes when you do that , but i never found it again but , if from that same expanded menu you select settings , instead of microsoft account , there 's a healthvault tab page that lets you connect to healthvault so that when you sign in to health vault \( on the phone or desktop \) you can access your exercise history under measurements history for any product team folks reading this , i recommend making this more intuitive finally , apologies , i signed in as my wife , above , even though i am the one with the question \) __eou__	Agent
PF	thank you for the detailed specifics regarding the app i 'll pass it on to support no apologies necessary but it was good of you to let us know __eou__	Agent
PA	hi , i think one reason can be why the gps data is not syncing because you might not have updated the app in your old phone the update contains the removal of health vault and will allow you to roam your data with your live account if you did n't update the app and changed your phone to new phone , then this new phone will be containing the updated app with no health vault connect feature and hence migration of data did n't happen please confirm if this is the case thanks __eou__	Agent

FD_OQ	i lost bing on windows 8 i can not fine on search i can not find in c drive windows or my programs i can not find a way redownload a new bing win 8 help it is at app store on laptop __eou__	User
FD	it sounds like you 're referring to the bing app that appears by default on the windows 8 start screen , correct \? it 's possible that the app was just unpinned from your start screen the first thing you might try is to right click on the start screen or swipe up from the bottom of the screen and click the all apps view here you should see a comprehensive list of all apps installed on your device if you find bing here , then you can just tap hold to pin it to the start screen again it 's also possible that the app was accidentally uninstalled bing is a windows store \( metro \) app , not a conventional windows program , so it cannot be managed through the control panel instead , you should check the windows store just open the store app , search for bing , and it will tell you whether or not it 's already installed on your device if not , you should be able to reinstall it from there it 's a free app , so that should take care of it if you 're using the windows 8 1 preview \( or the rtm \) , be advised that the bing app no longer exists in this release the bing app will not appear in the windows 8 1 store instead , bing has been integrated directly into the search hero , which is accessible from the search charm on the charms bar when you swipe from the right side of the screen \( or press win key c \) , tap search , and enter a search term while searching everywhere , your results will automatically incorporate results from bing there 's no longer a need for a separate app of course if you prefer a classic search experience , you can still pin the bing web page to the start screen just open ie , go to www bing com , tap favorites , and then tap pin to start you 'll get a big yellow live tile that just launches the site , shows trending topics , and basically functions like the aforementioned app and other tools , such as the bing desktop , can still be installed on the windows 8 1 desktop please let us know if that solves your issue thanks ! __eou__	Agent

IR_PA	did you set the hard disk mode to ide \? in order to install windows xp on the partition you created , you will need to boot into your bios and set the hard disk mode to ide after you have set the hard disk ide mode , you can proceed to install windows xp on the partition you created insert your windows xp cd , then restart your computer when prompted to boot from the cd , do so this requires pressing any key on your keyboard windows xp will go through its setup process once you arrive at the welcome setup , press enter on your keyboard to begin the setup process press f8 on your keyboard to accept the license agreement select the partition select format the partition using the ntfs file system press f on your keyboard to begin the formatting installation files will now be copied to your hard disk your system will be restarted , windows xp setup will continue after windows xp installs successfully , you will not be able to boot into windows 7 this is where the recovery disc for windows 7 comes in 1 put the windows 7 recovery disc installation disc into the disc drive , and then start the computer 2 press a key when the message indicating press any key to boot from cd or dvd appears 3 select a language , a time , a currency , and a keyboard or another input method , and then click next 4 click repair your computer 5 click the operating system that you want to repair , and then click next 6 in the system recovery options dialog box , click command prompt 7 type sfc scannow , and then press enter after you have repaired your windows 7 installation and try to boot it , you will notice that windows 7 does not boot boot into the bios again and set the hard disk mode to sata you will now be able to boot into windows 7 again after doing that , download easybcd and add a boot entry for windows xp to the windows 7 boot manager easybcd by neosmart technologies would be your answer , it provides a graphical front end to the bcdedit command line that makes it easy for you to define start up settings and edit boot entries on the new windowsboot manager http neosmart net dl php \? id 1 the next step now is make it possible for windows 7 to boot in ide mode here are the instructions for doing that http www vistax64 com general discussion 271218 switch ahci ide tutorial howto html welcome all , so let me explain i installed windows 7 with ahci set from bios , but after that i wanted to use ide \( becose it boots faster \) and when i set ide from bios , the windows 7 loading screan camed upp and bsod \( blue screen of death \) with an error code 0x0000005b , i tryed the regedit trick by setting in the hkey local machinesystemcurrentcontrolsetservicesmsahci and then in the right pan the start value from 0 i set it to 1 and it supposed to be working but it was a failiure , it still did the bsod and i was so pissed of , i wanted to make it work and i did it ! here are the pases 1 \) i assume u have installed windows vista or windows 7 with ahci set from bios ! 2 \) download my registry fix \( to add the ide keys to regeditor \) simply apply the key 3 \) now the manually regedit part go to hkey local machine system currentcontrolset services msahci hkey local machine system currentcontrolset services iastor hkey local machine system currentcontrolset services iastorv and in thease three keys in the right pan u will find a key named start change at all three \( msahci , iastor , iastorv \) values from 0 to 1 now navigate to hkey local machine system currentcontrolset services pciide , then change the start value to 0 4 \) now u are allmost done , restart your computer laptop , and go to bios and set from ahci to ide ! ! ! , save settings in bios and restart 5 \) windows will be loading , and voila ! ! ! no bsod ! ! ! , windows vista seven will install new ide drivers and u will see in windows device manager that you dont have ahci drivers anymore , u have ide drivers ! 6 \) it will prompt for another restart , just restart it and u will be happy the first option i would recommend , if you really need to run windows xp is to use windows virtual pc with windows xp mode , you will need to upgrade to windows 7 professional or ultimate in order to gain access to windows xp mode windows 7 anytime upgrade frequently asked questions http windows microsoft com en us windows7 windows anytime upgrade frequently asked questions windows 7 anytime upgrade features http windows microsoft com en us windows7 products features windows anytime upgrade or , if you have a full retail version of windows xp professional or xp home , you can download the free windows virtual pc and use your own license http techingiteasy wordpress com 2012 05 02 how to use virtualization softwarewindows virtual pc the other option , if you already have a windows xp license , is to dual boot with windows 7 the following instructions will show how to dual boot windows 7 and xp on your machine instead of replacing one with the other it is important you have a reinstallation or repair disc in case you need to reinstall or repair your windows 7 installation the following article will show you how to create a repair disc http notebooks com 2011 02 09 how to create a system repair disc in windows 7 __eou__	Agent

FD_OQ	hello everybody , this is my first question here , so i hope someone can help me out for a writing job i use a dot file from the company i'm working for it creates a bar of buttons that i can use to speed up workflow and use the right markup for publishing it works perfectly in word 2011 \( mac \) , but i recently updated to word 2016 \( mac \) in word 2016 the dot file will load , but the buttons wo n't work anymore i do see the buttons under the add ins tab the problem is that there are multiple drop down buttons that wo n't work when i click on them a single button \( with a single action \) does work is this a known issue \? is there any way to convert the dot file \? or is there any other way to use the dot in word 2016 \? thanks in advance for your help __eou__	User
IR_PA	hi tim , to clarify the issue , i d like you to confirm and provide the following 1 about i do see the buttons under the add ins tab the problem is that there are multiple drop down buttons that wo n't work when i click on them a single button \( with a single action \) does work , could you list the detailed reproducing steps and upload some related screenshots \? 2 upload a full screenshot of the page showing the version information of the word 2016 for mac application you are using you can access the page via word about word given the situation , i suggest you create a new document with word 2016 for mac directly and then copy the content from the dot file to the new file to see the outcome thanks , cliffthomas __eou__	Agent
PA	if your word 2011 dot file involved floating toolbars , you should know that those were axed from word 2016 , so you 're basically out of luck yes , it 's a known issue , but they did it on purpose and have no intention of making user created dot files compatible from 2011 forward to 2016 beyond the limited functionality you 've already discovered , where some buttons continue to work but others are either grayed out unclickable or do n't work as expected , even ones that have worked perfectly for years in 2011 i 've discovered that hard way that you basically need to be a professional programmer if you ever expect to figure out why , or how to fix them and in your case , it sounds like you did n't even create the original dot template your client company did so you 're probably locked out of editing anyway , even if you did have the coding knowledge you should either ask the company who supplied the dot file if they have an updated version of their template that works with word 2016 for mac , or you 'll need to go back to using word 2011 if your work requires the use of a template that only works in word 2011 or even if your workflows are just marginally sped up by being able to use those buttons then word 2016 probably is n't a viable solution for your needs do n't overthink it just go back to the version that worked __eou__	Agent

FQ	i have not purchased the new word yet but my colleague has and needs assistance now that the new word 2016 does not have publisher view can the print layout page allow for 1 kerning of letters \( publisher used to allow you to click the number up or down until you liked how it looks \) 2 shifting text boxes by measurements smaller than 1 8'' \( publisher allowed for smaller variables than 1 8 \) i think if i can fix these two problems , she may be okay if not , what is the most novice option other than downgrading to 2011 \? if she downgrades , can she return 2016 and get her money back \? __eou__	User
PA	hi rebecca , word 2016 for mac also has those functions regarding kerning of letters , you can refer to the following article to do so change the line spacing in word 2016 for mac about shifting text boxes , you can refer to the articles snap objects to a grid in word 2016 for mac align objects in word 2016 for mac regards frasermegan __eou__	Agent
FD_PA	what the contextual ribbon for publishing layout view in prior versions does provide is a check box tool for turning kerning on off , but there is no manual kerning in any version of word perhaps you 're thinking of the character spacing tool which does provide incremental spinner buttons as well as editable value boxes \? at any rate , neither is included on the ribbon in office 2016 however , both are available as they always have been in their home location format font advanced i see no option to add either to the qat but i'm not certain whether they can be added to the ribbon in word 2016 , objects can be nudged in 1 100 increments by holding command control while tapping an arrow key also , the grid which controls the standard nudging increment can be modified word preferences edit grid options word 2011 is at the end of its life cycle i have no idea what type of projects are involved , but based on your use of the term novice it may be worth looking at page layout programs they are object oriented , whereas word is not __eou__	Agent

OQ	how to auto fill in sequence numbering on a filtered data excel spreadsheet \? __eou__	User
PA	you can do this if you have a range that is not an excel table if you are using a table , you need to convert it to a range first filter the range select the cells where you want the auto numbering to go , for example the visible cells in column b , starting in the first visible row below the header hit f5 special visible cells only ok if the first visible row of data is in row 43 , enter this formula into b43 but do n't hit enter yet ! max \( b 1 b42 \) 1 the formula refers to all rows above in this example , row 43 is the first visible data row in the filtered range , so the formula refers to rows 1 to 42 hold down the ctrl key and hit enter the formula will now be applied to all the visible cells now you can remove the filter to see that the consecutive numbering has only been applied to the rows that you had previously showing does that help \? cheers , lori __eou__	Agent
PA	hi , try this 1 suppose your data is in range a1 c500 headings are in a1 c1 2 you wish to enter the headings in column a 3 type 1 in cell a2 4 enter this formula in cell a3 and copy down till cell a500 subtotal \( 3 , b 2 b2 \) 1 i have assumed that column b will not have any blanks if there are blanks in column b , then change the column in the formula to one in which there are no blanks now when you apply a filter , the numbers in column a will appear sequential hope this helps __eou__	Agent
FD_FQ	if i follow this example i believe i have the opposite problem i want to number only those rows that are visible in the filtered view i believe this solution will calculate what the row number would be if all the rows were visible \( rows 1 through 42 \) how can i filter my data \( which would cause sporadic invisible hidden rows throughout the list \) and then only those rows that are visible \? __eou__	Agent
