OQ	when i insert an audio file into powerpoint , the default position of the inserted icon is in the center of the slide that blocks some of the text , so i 'd like the default position to be in the bottom right corner of the slide when an audio file is inserted i can move the icon manually , but i have hundreds of slides to do this for is there a way to change the default alignment when inserting a file \? alternatively , is there a way to align all audio icons in a presentation at once \? thanks for your help ! __eou__	User
PA	why not create the first slide and place sound where you want then duplicate the side and change content after duplicating the number of slides as far as i know , you have to move the audio item like you have unless someone has a macro that will work disclaimer the questions , discussions , opinions , replies answers i create , are solely mine and mine alone and do not reflect upon my position as a community moderator __eou__	Agent
PA	hi ryan , it is not feasible to move all the audio icons on your presentation at once , as well as change the default position for the inserted file you many need to move the position of them one by one , you can also try brittany 's suggestion to check if it helps we understand this may be inconvenient for you , if you 'd like to have the feature in powerpoint , we invite you to submit this idea in our powerpoint uservoice uservoice is the best way to let related team know users' requirement , as well as perfect our products and service thanks for your understanding joannerichard __eou__	Agent

RQ	same here ! lost my skype contacts , history and credit on both my pc and my iphone would not let me use my old password , forced me to change it , and now it 's all gone very frustrating thanks for nothing , microsoft ! __eou__	Agent
RQ	i have exactly the same problem ! ! __eou__	Agent
CQ_FD	the problem seems to be due to a confusion between my skype account and my microsoft account skype has against my will switched to using my microsoft account instead of my skype account all of my credits and history are in my skype account , not my microsoft account i have been using skype for many uears , so they are linked to the same email until yesterday , this had not been a problem __eou__	Agent
PA	hello michael , welcome to skype community forum ! if you cannot see your contacts , history and credit , you may check if you 're logged in to the correct account you can also use this link click here to check how many accounts associated with your email address let me know if you 're still getting the same problem __eou__	Agent
FD_RQ	ended up being the same for me so now have 2 accounts just have to make sure to log in to the right one very annoying __eou__	User
PA	hello michael , thank you for the response i definitely understand why you feel that way , but please be informed that since skype has been acquired by microsoft , the option to sign in to skype using your microsoft account is possible if you sign up using mobile number , your skype name is live \( alphanumeric \) called lightweight account and if you sign up using email , your skype name is your email address thus , if you did not link your skype and microsoft account and you 've signed in to skype using your email address , skype will create you an account with pre determined skype name you can link your skype and microsoft accounts to avoid the confusion from having two separate accounts this way , you can also sign in to skype using your email address microsoft account without routing you to a different account i hope this information helps but if you have questions and clarifications , please do not hesitate to reply __eou__	Agent

FD_OQ	i recently contacted the help desk for office 2016 for the mac about changing the font sizes in the navigation pane and in the comment balloons i could not figure out a way to do this from within the navigation pane or the review menu i tried several levels of microsoft support but we couldn t make it work after hanging up , i kept trying for a while and here s is what finally worked navigation pane have the navigation pane open select format styles from the word menu choose document map style under the styles pull down menu choose the styles fonts sizes that you want click apply comment balloons have comment balloons displayed and then highlight some text from any comment select format styles from the word menu choose the comment text style make your changes and then click apply this is new to me but it seems to work every time i would appreciate seeing if others can validate this approach __eou__	User
PA	at least in winword , you have to modify not only comment text but also balloon text to ensure that text inside comments have the formatting you want \( modifying the document map style does not work at all in recent versions of winword it did work in the document map , the predecessor of the navigation pane \) __eou__	Agent
PA_PF	it would seem to me that you 've already validated these methods , yourself \) i have no idea what was suggested by the support folks you spoke with , but the methods you 've described are n't just one way , they 're the only way iow , that 's what should have been suggested to begin with the one point that differs is that it is not necessary to open the navigation pane or have any comments in a document in order to modify the styles which determine their formatting the styles can be modified at any time , including when you start in a new blank document it 's just that the styles are a bit easier to locate if they are in use if not currently in use you have to select all styles in the dialog window , then find those you want in a rather lengthy list __eou__	Agent

FD_PA	as i wrote , the document map style controlled the appearance of entries in the document map in older versions of word the appearance of entries in the navigation pane ca n't be customized at all \( the document map style exists only for backward compatibility reasons \) that is how it works in windows versions of word we will have to wait for someone to confirm how it works in word 2016 for mac __eou__	Agent

OQ	hi there the dell e6420 laptop i have is at the legacy not uefi set up i have read that by resetting it to uefi i might be able to increase the hdd capacity to 2tb however , i would like to know how this would affect the machine in booting and performance when i changed it to uefi to see , i found the boot sequences that were ticked for legacy were grayed out as if no more applicable so , please advise what are the pros cons if changed to uefi and if that is necessary at all the machine as of now , is working fine thanks __eou__	User
PA	do you already have an operating system installed in legacy mode \? if so switching to eufi mode will stop the os from booting you will have to have a eufi bootable drive to install an os like windows 10 yes the benefits are that 2tb and bigger partitions are supported as well as supporting fast boot eufi is faster and more efficient than legacy hope that helps ! __eou__	Agent
FD_PA	you 'll need to reinstall to uefi , booting the installation media as a uefi device to delete all partitions down to unallocated space to clear the formatting as illustrated in the gold standard clean install here http answers microsoft com en us windows wiki windows 10 windows install clean reinstall windows 10 upgradefactory oem 1c426bdf 79b1 4d42 be93 17378d93e587 this is worth it because then you 'll have the full modern features of the bios replacing uefi which offers better security , gui with mouse support , and other improvements http www youtube com watch \? v drmivy7bil4 a legacy install should eventually be replaced with uefi before reinstall enable uefi in bios , if necessary csm or legacy mode while you have an mbr drive still needing to boot , secure boot you may need to turn off fast boot if it wo n't pause long enough to boot the installation media when you power up pressing the dell f12 key but after install turn fast boot on unless you need to boot media as you 'll access bios via recovery settings __eou__	Agent

FD_NF	first , i want to say thank you for taking the time to respond to my dilemma here i followed all of your instructions , and the app is still not working i should mention that it was a very clean uninstall , and there was no leftover registry data or folders i searched for them as you instructed , but there was nothing there , even with hidden folders unhidden i also checked the bing bar \( i do n't use it , but i figured i 'd check it \) and it has the same problem as bing desktop it 's visible , but none of the pulldown menus or icons do anything except become highlighted after i press them i doubt this is it , but do these app require facebook integration \? i recently deleted my facebook account , and then went through the process of disconnecting facebook from my microsoft account so i would stop getting emails about reconnecting the facebook account to my microsoft one i do n't remember if it was the same day , but it was around the same time that bing desktop stopped working thank you for any help you can give me beyond this point , but i'm not really sure what 's left \? a clean uninstall followed by a reinstall , with a program that apparently no one else is having a problem with i have an antivirus program and a malware removal tool as well , and both show my pc as being clean i really do n't understand why this refuses to work __eou__	User

PA	hi , thank you for posting the query on microsoft community forums you have reached the right place let us work together to find the root cause of this issue and try resolving it one of the more difficult questions to answer about a bing map involves determining the exact scale or resolution of a particular image the answer is complicated as resolution depends on several factors including the current latitude and longitude scale is further dependent on screen resolution in this article we will look at the factors that affect scale and resolution and provide you with formulas you can use to calculate approximate values i would suggest you to see the following link for more information understanding scale and resolution http msdn microsoft com en us library aa940990 aspx post us the results after you try the above steps __eou__	Agent
FQ	jennifer , is this a joke \? __eou__	Agent
FD	i checked out the post it said a lot of complex stuff about calculations to find the exact scale i am not trying to find the exact scale , just a general idea for example , if two points on my screen are 1 3 of my screen apart , are they a foot apart , a mile apart , or a thousand miles apart \? there is no way to tell unless you already know a distance and can measure it and compare it the post says that if you do n't need exact , you can just use the scale shown on the map screen but there is no scale on the map screen that is want i am trying to get to show somehow , it must have come in a turned off condition on my computer __eou__	Agent
FD_NF	i gave up looking for a fix for this it may have been a browser issue , i use firefox but have you upgraded to the new bing maps \? i was forced to upgrade and it is slower , but at least the scale problem is fixed for me in the new version too bad i had to upgrade as the old bing maps worked much better for me than google __eou__	Agent

OQ	in the google search bar you can view and select past searches very convenient with the bing search bar , however , it will only keep 3 of my past searches so that it can have room to show its suggested searches i have no interest in miley cyrus and am really annoyed that she 's given priority over searches that i 've typed in how do i stop this permanently \? i thought i cleared it once , but it just came right back the next time i opened i'm trying out bing instead of google , but not having access to past searches might pull me back again i'm running ie10 on windows 7 x64bit i did n't find this specific topic when searching the other discussions found were regarding suggested searches that came up while typing , or suggested sites in the favorites bar thanks in advance __eou__	User
FD	apparently there 's no more support for the bing toolbar i should also add that the 3 searches kept were not the most recent , but seemed randomly selected over all searches entered in the last week or so the 3 shown would be different when a new window was opened not very useful for me , but i guess it 's fine for others i 've gone back to google , which i really wanted to avoid then again , there 's no reason microsoft wo n't start collecting data on its user 's like google does , anyway i looked into yahoo , but reviewers were reporting malware being downloaded with the recent version __eou__	User

FD_PA	hi , windows 10 creators update requires a hard disk space of at least 16 gb for a 32 bit operating system or 20 gb for a 64 bit operating system if your storage space is not enough to install windows 10 creators update , you can try freeing some drive space here s a link that would walk you through the steps on how to free up drive space in windows 10 we launch updates to add new features and ensure that your system is working efficiently you can schedule update using active hours in windows 10 however , we have yet to include the option to decline or stop the update we recommend that you post your suggestion to our feedback hub by following the steps below 1 type feedback hub in cortana search and launch the app 2 navigate to feedback in the left menu and press add new feedback 3 select the problem , and share any details you think are relevant , and choose an appropriate category and subcategory 4 important if possible , reproduce the problem \( s \) after clicking begin monitoring \( or start capture \) near the end of the form stop monitoring when you re done 5 once you ve completed the form and monitoring , click submit 6 click continue using feedback hub 7 click my feedback at the top , and then find the item you submitted \( it may take a while to appear \) 8 open the item you submitted and click share 9 click copy link , then paste the link here in your response \( it will look like https aka ms unique link \) you can visit this link for the instruction on how to set active hours in windows 10 let us know if you need additional assistance __eou__	Agent
CQ_IR	are you saying that this update adds an additional 20gb to the already existing operating system or does the update rewrite overwrite replace the operating system with the new version \? if 20 gb is a total , i can handle it as my original question stated , there is nothing i can remove to create more space , however i will do the things you suggested anyway after i receive your answer to this email thanks ! __eou__	User
FD_PA	once you have installed a new update , it will replace the existing dll files that help run the operating system installing an update means that you will have a new build which comes with new features and functionalities this also means that some of the features and functionalities from the old build is no longer available here s an article that talks about the new features that comes with the windows 10 creators update a new update does not add additional storage space 20 gb is the minimum amount of space that the new update would consume once you successfully installed it that is the reason why it is required to have at least 20 gb of free storage space for a 64 bit operating system before installing the update you can visit this link for the information about the system requirements and other important details if you have other questions , feel free to reach out to us __eou__	Agent

OQ	dear all , i am using ms word 2013 and have put all of my tables at the end of my document but , when i cross refer it into my main body of the draft , and update the fields and automatic table of contents , ms word insert the whole table into the main body as well is there any way to cross refer the tables without this issue i think i am messing with caption or something like this but have absolutely no idea how to tackle this currently , i manually remove the whole table and its caption , but it again comes when i update table fields by selection all document please help __eou__	User
PA	the cross reference function in word makes use of hidden bookmarks when you create a cross reference , word encloses the cross referenced item in a bookmark the problem with bookmarks is that you can easily expand them by mistake for example , this happens if you add text , or press enter , at the beginning of a bookmarked paragraph to work around this limitation , always add new paragraphs at the end of an existing paragraph once the problem has occurred , the easiest fix is to recreate the cross reference , as you have noticed __eou__	Agent
CQ	thank you jason for your reply can you please tell me what is meant by adding new paragraph at the end of an existing paragraph i just press enter to start a new paragraph is there some other proper way __eou__	User
PA	you can easily tell what i mean by adding a manual bookmark to a text paragraph and enable the option \( in file options advanced \) to show bookmarks bookmarked text the brackets illustrate that the whole paragraph is bookmarked now , if you click at the very beginning of the paragraph and type something , or press enter , you 'll notice that the bookmark expands to include the new content bookmarked text in other words , the bookmarked text now includes a paragraph mark in fact , anything that you add at the beginning of a bookmarked paragraph will be added inside the bookmark this will cause trouble when you update a cross reference that makes use of the bookmark when you let word create hidden bookmarks \( and it always does when you make use of the cross reference function \) , the situation is even more tricky the hidden bookmarks behave the way i illustrated above , but you ca n't see them \( even if you choose to display bookmarks at file options advanced \) __eou__	Agent
FQ	thank you again for explaining it clearly you pointed out right i think my document has hidden bookmarks , but , nevertheless i now have a fair idea what is happening just one more thing , if i myself write a bookmark in bracket like insert table \( bookmark \) , is this one of the reasons to cause this problem __eou__	User
PA	hidden bookmarks are created by word at the time you create a cross reference to an item there is no way to prevent it from happening i do n't know what you mean by insert table \( bookmark \) are you referring to caption labels \? these work the same way if you cross reference a table \( or figure \) caption , word creates a hidden bookmark __eou__	Agent

PA	hello leroy , thank you for the response ! i definitely understand that you want to export the chat history that is saved on your mobile device unfortunately , that is not possible this is because the chat conversations are stored in cloud if you needed to compile the chat history , the only option i can suggest is to take a screenshot if it but if that is needed for legal purposes , please check the private message i sent for further discussion if you have any questions and clarifications , please do not hesitate to reply back __eou__	Agent

OQ	even though i clearly have the error blocked off for each sentence in activedocument paragraphs j j 1 on error goto hey third word \( j \) sentence range words \( 3 \) sw \( j \) sentence range words \( 2 \) tot sent \( j \) sentence range text hey next the code is still throwing error 5941 the requested member collection does not exist that is exactly the type of error that i'm trying to except and make the code continue a lot of the paragraphs do not have a third word so i only want to put a sentence into the tot sent array if the sentence has a third word the best way to do this is through error handling but it is not working post moved by the moderator to the appropriate forum category __eou__	User
PA	remove the colon from behind the label hey on the error goto statement i'm not sure that 's the problem but i 've never seen a goto label referenced like that the label itself does include the colon , but that just indicates that what proceeds it on the command line is a label , it 's not part of the label i also just , if you already have n't done it is to put an option explicit statement at the start of the module where the subroutine for this code resides it will then require that all variable you use be declared i mention it because i do n't know what type of variable sentence refers to and statements like sentence range are not valid if i am misunderstanding something please let me know it might also be helpful to show us the entire subroutine where this code resides because we can better understand the context and environment where the code exists __eou__	Agent
PA	i think you will be better off with a structure like this for each sentence in activedocument paragraphs j j 1 on error goto hey third word \( j \) sentence range words \( 3 \) sw \( j \) sentence range words \( 2 \) tot sent \( j \) sentence range text hey resume afterthis afterthis next and optionally put err clear before the resume afterthis statement if you want to ignore the error completely the thing with error trapping is that once the error has been raised , vba is in an active error handler until it executes an exit sub exit function exit property or resume statement so after the first error , control passes to the hey then the error handler is active so although the next for , the j j 1 and on error got hey are executed with error , vba is still in an active error handler when it next executes the third word \( j \) sentence range words \( 3 \) , and at that point it gives up and displays the error so by using resume afterthis even to move to the next statement , you deactivate the error handler and the next error is handled as before __eou__	Agent
FD_PF	actually , i found a word around before you answered the question for each sentence in activedocument paragraphs if sentence range words count 2 then 'some code end if next that did the trick but thanks for your help in any case __eou__	User

OQ	hi there , i am asking on behalf of my director he runs excel \( office installed from o365 \) on a mac and experiences the following issues 1 when working on a spreadsheet and using the find function \( ctrl f \) the top search bar does n't change to the cell contents found , but remains on the cell initially stood on before the find window is activated 2 the cell number in the left margin is not highlighted when moving on to the contents found 3 unable to navigate through the spreadsheet when the find window is open have to close the window first before being able to scroll on can someone please assist and advise if this is perhaps a ms bug or mac compatibility issues \? i have also tested this on another colleagues' machine with the same specs and software thank you __eou__	User
CQ_IR_PA	from what i can understand , it sounds like all is working as expected 3 that 's correct the find dialog is modal , so nothing can be done in the worksheet as long as it is displayed however , if a found instance is located outside the current viewing area the sheet will scroll automatically in order to display that instance 1 i'm not sure what you mean by top search bar there are 2 possibilities using find replace does move the cell selector from one found instance to the next , but it does not cause the reference in the name box to change with each move when the dialog window is closed , the reference in the name box updates based on the currently selected cell the search sheet control is not directly associated with excel 's find replace feature if using that , the reference in the name box does update each time the are used to move to the next found instance 2 i'm afraid i have no idea what you mean by cell number in the left margin if this does n't address your concern , please clarify as much as possible also , include the version license info from excel about excel in your reply __eou__	Agent
FD_NF	hi cybertaz i managed to take a screenshot to assist my question i searched for hot , and this is in cell a22 however the cell reference shows a8 a8 is the cell i was in when i activated the find function and does n't change when clicking on find i tested this in excel on windows and the cell reference change to where the contents are found __eou__	Agent

OQ	this may be a silly question , but from all of my searching i could not find the solution anywhere else i have just recently began using windows 10 , but i prefer the look of the windows 7 start menu which is what i 've been using up until now this first picture is one i found online of how i would like to have my start menu look but this is a picture of how my start menu currently looks i do n't care about any of the tiles , thats why i unpinned them , but what i do want is for the text to appear next to the folders i have pinned there \( documents , downloads , pictures , etc \) my only guess is that it could be due a difference in windows versions \? currently running windows 10 home edition __eou__	User
FD_PA	your guess is correct in previous windows 10 builds , labels appeared next to the icons on the start menu so your first picture is from a previous build , your second picture is from a current build but you stated that you prefer the look of the windows 7 start menu have you looked at the free classic shell or the 5 start10 download \? either one would allow you to customize your start menu as you wish , and even return you to a very windows 7 ish appearance not endorsing them , but if you 're not happy with your current start menu , you do have a few options __eou__	Agent

FD_PA	no , afraid not swfs are not importable under any ppt version , mac or windows if you have flash , i understand from what i 've read that you can use it to export your swf to other movie formats another approach would be to play the swf on your computer \( e g in the browser or other viewer \) and use screen recording software to capture the video and save in a more ppt friendly format the usual go to site for conversions , zamzar com , supports converting other things to swf , but does n't seem to convert from swf to anything else __eou__	Agent

FD	i suppose it depends on what you mean by importing ppt 's never been able to handle swfs on its own in the way it does wmf , emf , png and other such importable formats if you mean that you inserted a flash control to host the swf , that 's a different matter according to this web page , it still works here 's another page from ppt mvp ellen finkelstein that addresses versions of ppt through 2013 i do n't imagine 2016 has changed especially i 'd be wary of using flash for presentations that 'll go out to other people they may not have , or be permitted to have , flash on their computers __eou__	Agent

CQ	hello i would agree with tiffany , that you may of just deleted a shortcut i am a windows 8 user , so what you may of done is unpinned word from your taskbar or start screen , or even the desktop on the start screen , do n't click anything , just start typing in word and a program should show up named word 2013 and that should be it also , did you uninstall anything from the control panel \? hopefully this helps , feel free to write back with more questions __eou__	Agent

PA	hi stephanie , welcome to the skype community forum i can see why you are concerned let me provide you an information regarding this skype is always making improvements , such as enhanced quality , better reliability , and improved security because we want everyone to experience the best skype has to offer , it 's sometimes necessary to retire older versions of skype , and skype enabled devices these decisions are hard to make , but will enable us to focus our efforts on transitioning skype from a peer to peer video and chat app to a modern , mobile friendly cloud architecture that being said , you must at least have an android version 6 0 or higher to be able to download and install skype if your device is no longer supported , you can stay in touch with friends and family using another skype supported device the latest versions of skype for all supported devices are available here you can sign in using the same skype account please let us know if you have questions regards , rhiza ebrandy skype community moderator __eou__	Agent

PA	hi arthur welcome to the skype community forum i know how important it is for you to edit the phone number of your contacts let me explain this to you if the number is his profile number \( saved by the owner \) , it cannot be deleted it can only be changed by the user itself however , you can add a secondary number on his profile which you can edit or delete please let us know if you have questions rhiza esamantha skype community moderator __eou__	Agent
CQ_FQ	oh so this is not a personal address book \( is there any way to hide the numbers i do n't want to see \? having to select the right number per contact can be cumbersome thanks for your reply thanks __eou__	User
RQ	why ca n't i delete phone numbers in my contacts , please tell me how to do it \? it should not be difficult __eou__	Agent
FD_NF	according to the previous answer , skype provides contact names with numbers that the contact themselves updates in their profile we cannot manipulate the numbers because they are being pulled from other people 's profiles it 's like opening a phone book you do n't provide the numbers , the people and businesses that belong to those numbers do so if you change your phone numbers in your personal skype profile , it will update everyone 's skype contact list this is good if you would rather have up to date information from your list this is bad if you prefer \( like i do \) not to see every single number from every contact that you 'll never use or care about i really want my own , personal skype phone book that i can edit like a regular contact book in every other program i use , not one that can be manipulated by outsiders __eou__	User
FD_PA	hi arthur , thank you for getting back to us yes , it 's not a personal address book which you can edit or delete anytime you want however , you can add a secondary number like what i 've mentioned the account owner only has the authority to modify the phone number on his account and apparently , there 's no settings to hide the phone numbers in the skype app we apologize for the inconvenience we 'd be glad to hear your feedback please let us know if you have any other questions rhiza esamantha skype community moderator __eou__	Agent
FQ	thank you i 've left feedback i prefer to have a personal address book that i can edit or delete anytime does n't this also raise a privacy issue \? if someone hacks a skype account , they get all the contact info from all the users connected to the hacked skype account instead of only the contact information the account owner would have added themselves otherwise seems like there would be less chance of full exposure of other user 's account information just a thought __eou__	User
GG	hi arthur , thank you for your prompt reply rest assured that your feedback will be noted and forwarded to our developers please continue participating in the skype community forum to share us your thoughts and inputs we 'd love to hear more from you thanks , rhiza esamantha skype community moderator __eou__	Agent

OQ	hello , my dad passed away two weeks ago after a long battle with alzheimer 's and before he passed he gave me his computer which runs windows 7 as it 's os what i would like to know is if it 's possible to erase the hard drive and download windows 8 1 that i have on my computer \? please i'm not computer savvy and i do n't know if what i'm asking makes any sense so please forgive me if it does n't thank you __eou__	User
PA	hi crystal my name is ron yes your question does make sense it is a good idea to re install windows on a new used computer that you get from someone else re installing windows wipes out all of their files , any potential malware they may have picked up and it gets rid of any software they installed that you do n't need before you do it , it is always a good idea to backup the data files at the very least to some other location better yet , it is a good idea to make an image copy backup so that you have a known good point to restore to if you run into problems doing the windows install sorry , there is very little chance you can transfer your copy of windows 8 to this computer if windows 8 came with the other computer , you simply cannot transfer it what you can most likely do is use the build in recovery feature to reset your computer to factory fresh this short how to video is pretty good https www youtube com watch \? v ra1lsmlwefi note if you have any programs instaled you want to keep , ie office , you need to make sure you have the product key or serial number you need to reintall those applications as well you 'll need the install files or disk you can download up to office 2007 from ms , other applications you 'll have to check to see what they say if you find a reply has fixed your problem please click on the accept this answer blue hyperlink button please grade your satisfaction with our replies by clicking on one of the green yellow red option buttons your grading our answers helps improve our service __eou__	Agent
PA	hi , this is sarah from the microsoft community lets see if we can get your problem resolved since the computer already comes with a valid license for windows 7 , i would just perform a factory reset and set it up with a new user account new computers that come preinstalled with windows often have what is called a recovery partition this is used to reinstall the operating system in the event of a system crash to access it , you will need to boot into when you start your computer by pressing a function key this can be either f1 , f2 , f9 , f10 , f11 , f12 or even del or tab key consult the owners manual that came with your pc for instructions about how to reinstall windows this is how the recovery partition is accessed for the most popular makes for dell , press ctrl f11 directly after powering up the unit for hp , press f11 directly after powering up the unit for lg , press f11 directly after powering up the unit for toshiba , press and hold '0' before and during the power up for acer , press and hold alt f10 as soon as you see the logo for asus , press f9 as soon as you see the asus logo for samsung , press f4 at power up for fujitsu , press the f8 key repeatedly directly after powering up for advent , restart your computer then press f10 repeatedly until the message starting system recovery is displayed for sony vaio , restart and press f8 or f10 repeatedly until the advanced boot options screen appears if you want to run something newer than windows 7 , you might still be able to get windows 10 for free https www groovypost com howto download windows 10 free best , andresarah windows insider mvp mvp windows and devices for it http twitter com adacosta __eou__	Agent

PA	for several years , the standard advice has been to not delete files from c windowsinstaller \( assuming that 's what you 're referring to \) see , for example , back in the xp days , microsoft had a utility named msizap exe that removed orphaned entries from the installer directory \( generally , it is these orphaned entries that take up much of the space \) , but that utility does not work with windows 7 i 've recently become aware of a similar utility developed by someone not affiliated with microsoft http www homedev com au free patchcleaner i have no information about this utility other than what 's on that web site if you use it , you do so at your own risk if i were going to use it , i would make a full system backup first , just in case i 'd also follow the developer 's recommendation to move the files to external media rather than deleting them __eou__	Agent

RQ	i have the same problem first on my desktop running windows 8 1 , then a week later my tablet running windows 8 1 rt and now my laptop i 've followed all the troubleshooting steps above and on the microsoft support site but the best i can do is get it to run after installation as soon as i start the app a second time the weather app fails it still works on a table running windows 8 1 the app itself does n't crash , it simply sits there with the little icon going round in circles , as if it is waiting for something the machines themselves behave normally otherwise and no errors are reported in the logs it 'll be interesting to see how long my tablet lasts before the weather app fails it did make me wonder is microsoft if phasing out support for the weather app on windows 8 just like it has for other apps __eou__	Agent

FD_PA	i am not sure , but i suspect this is a memory issue microsoft likes to add bells and whistles for the marketing types not realizing that excel is used by the accounting types and we hate the bells and whistles , especially when they stop us from doing our jobs they also assume that each time they put out a new product your computer power x10 to find out if this is the case , we can look to see if you are doing other things using a lot of memory common ones in my experience are vlookups over a large range , conditional formatting over a large range , or a random cell like xxa876583 having a space instead of being blank , which means that not only does excel store the space in cell xxa876583 , but it stores in memory that every other cell above and left of that cell is blank \( well , and it stores the data you care about too \) the third is the easiest to fix and wo n't be a bother for you , just go to the lower right corner of your data and see if your scroll bars are at the bottom left if they are not , scroll left to the edge of the scroll bar , then delete all columns between where you now are and your data do the same thing with rows from the bottom of the scroll bar to the bottom of your data for conditional formatting , well ouch turn it off for vlookups or other complex formulas , well ouch , do a copy paste special values and replace your formulas with numbers if that still does n't solve your problem maybe post the file \? __eou__	Agent
CQ_FD	i have 8gb of memory installed ctrl end takes me to the bottom right corner of the data on my sheet so i do n't think there are any extra columns or rows on the sheet that i ca n't see i do have one column that does vlookups so that would be 100 cells , but the lookup range is only 2 columns by 17 rows ctrl end takes me to the bottom right corner of that range i also have three columns of totals max lookups that would be 300 cells of formulas i made a copy of the spreadsheet and erased all those lookup and formula cells , but i still can only sort 48 rows the total sheet is 40 columns by 107 rows how can i post it so you could look at it \? gary p __eou__	User
FD	god , i really wish someone else was trying to help too , cause i'm frankly stumped just to find out if i am mostly wrong or totally wrong , can you try an experiment for me \? do the ctrl alt del thing and open task manager , click on processes and then select excel then do your sort and see if excel 's memory usage goes nuts granted , if it does n't i have no idea what the problem is , and if it does i do n't know what the cause of the memory issue would be , but my first rule of troubleshooting , is narrow the cause down ok , that is n't true , my first rule is shut up and reboot , but that does n't apply here \) at this point i 'd even appreciate a microsoft employee on the thread , they would n't do anything , but maybe someone who knows something would then show up to correct them other questions on the narrow it down theme what happens if you copy the worksheets in the workbook to a new workbook and save it , and then try to sort the new workbook \? similar trick , copy the cells that you are trying to sort and paste \( probably paste values \) them into a new workbook and sort there \? what version of office are you using \? does this only happen when you sort by one particular column , or does it happen regardless of which column you sort by \? if it is only one column , what else is happening in the column \? do you have another workbook with a similar sized chunk of information \( 40 columns \) that you can try to sort to see if it is just the one workbook set of data or if it is a general your copy of excel problem \? does the number of rows you can sort by change if you just select some of your columns and sort them \( do n't save just in case it does work , but \) \? i routinely do sorts on workbooks that i have to move from excel 97 format to modern excel format because the 65k row limit is less than my number of rows , so this one is surprising to me __eou__	Agent

PA	your first two suggestions 1 \) what happens if you copy the worksheets in the workbook to a new workbook and save it , and then try to sort the new workbook \? 2 \) similar trick , copy the cells that you are trying to sort and paste \( probably paste values \) them into a new workbook and sort there \? what version of office are you using \? thank you , thank you , thank you ! ! ! the first thing i tried was copying the cells into a new workbook yeah , it worked i saved the old workbook and someday i might take some more time and try to figure out what was happening , but for now , your solution solved the problem thanks again , gary p __eou__	User
FD_PA	you are quite welcome , glad i could help as for the old workbook , i would n't bother as long as you have what you need files can become corrupt \( well , not corrupt in the traditional sense , but odd rules start to apply to older files that do n't make sense or apply to new files \) , and you never know what is attached to a workbook that you ca n't see the copy all sheets into new workbook , trick is one i use from time to time just to deal with an excel file that is unusually large or slow compared to how it should be i do n't know exactly what is happening in that situation , i just know the fix \) if there was some formula that was broken by doing that trick or you lost some data then it might be worth going back , but __eou__	Agent

OQ	hi all , i have a skype number that we use for our office our thought process was that a skype number would be handier , since there are three of us and we 're often out of the office that way we would n't miss calls however , we are often finding that we miss calls anyway we have a mac laptop each \( running latest copy of skype \) and iphone \( running latest copy of skype \) , and we find that when a call comes in , sometimes one of them will ring , sometimes two or more , but sometimes none of them will , despite being signed in i can look at skype on my phone , which will then update and tell me i have three missed calls i cannot seem to get to the bottom of what is causing this is it because we have too many devices people logged into the same account at the same time \? or is this an inherent problem within skype itself \? should i only run skype on the phone perhaps , and sign out if we 're not the one 'marked as watching the phone' no idea having recently lost a contract because we missed an important call i'm at the point of cancelling skype and reverting to a landline , even though i know we 'll miss calls if nobody is there i may have to pay someone to sit in an empty office just to take the one or two calls a day we get any help or advice on this really appreciated __eou__	User
PA	hello jonathanbunker , welcome to the skype community ! i know how important this is for you i 'd be glad to assist you on this technically , signing in to multiple devices using the same account mostly caused this issue if you do n't want to miss a call from your skype number , i would suggest you to set up call forwarding call forwarding lets you forward your skype calls to voice messaging , a landline or mobile number , or another skype contact your incoming calls will be forwarded even if you 're not signed in to skype for more information , click here hope this information helps let me know if you need further assistance thank you ! __eou__	Agent

FD	david , i left out an important part of the question your formula worked perfect i forgot that g23 is not a set value g23 is a formula also g23 formula is g23 if \( g19 asphalt stabilized base , 84 98 , if \( g19 c coarse surface , 95 100 , if \( g19 d fine surface , 0 \) \) \) the problem i am have my new formula for q23 does not know what range to use out of g23 \? __eou__	User
FD_PA	the formula in q23 will work even if g23 is a formula all it does is compare what is entered in j23 to what is to the left and to the right of the in cell g23 if j23 is inbetween those two numbers it shows a check mark , if j23 is outside of the range , it shows an x does that answer your question \? __eou__	Agent
FQ	can you walk me through getting to the edit formatting rule menu \? __eou__	User

OQ	hello , i noticed there 's a bug when someone sends you a file multiple times with the same name , if you click the link for file received in skype window you get the very first file that was sent but explorer renames the file to add \( 1 \) , \( 2 \) and so on and it 's confusing how can i report it this problem \? i got lots of skype faq pages but no direct link best regards , david __eou__	User
PA	this is not a bug the behaviour is intentional whenever you receive a file on skype , it is saved to a folder specified in tools options im settings if you receive multiple files with the same name , then subsequent files are saved in the same folder but with an extra index \( 1 \) , \( 2 \) , etc __eou__	Agent
FD	hi ruwim , i understand the renaming behaviour is intentional \( and very useful \) in explorer , the problem is with skype window that tells you file received and you get the first version when you click directly on the link to open it instead of the last file received this has happened to me , someone sent me a report document that was changed but could n't find any changes when opened via skype and missed important information of the report that was added now i have to warn everyone that they need to right click the file , select show in folder and open the last file received via explorer \( that shows correctly the renamed file \) , this is annoying and time wasting imho it would be more useful to create new folders with name of the folder based on date and time \( e g 2017 09 28 14 35 58 \) where new files can be received and if they have the same name , skype should report the renamed version , this way skype received files would not contain lots of obsolete files received from other people which makes finding the last received file even more difficult __eou__	User
FD_PA	i'm not sure why this happens for you , but i have several files with the same name \( dxdiag txt \) saved in my my skype received files folder each has the extra index attached , but when i click on the file in skype , the correct version opens this is how it should work links to received sent files are saved in the local main db database file , and should point to the correct version __eou__	Agent

FD_PA	i think we need to clarify your question if your cell is in sheet1 ! b14 to tell other cells to display \( and allow you to use the value of \) that cell , put in those cells sheet1 ! b14 if you want to take the value that is in the cell and put it in those other cells , you can copy , then do a paste special and choose values this will copy the value of the cell you are copying from rather than the formula to paste special either click the downward arrow just below paste in the macro bar or right click the cell you want to paste into and below paste options will be paste special if you copy a cell with a formula , excel will automatically copy it 's relations to other cells in a relative , manner , so if your formula in the cell is a12 b6 and you copy your formula to a cell two cells lower it will become a14 b8 so fix this use fixed references , which are indicated with a symbol so if you want to copy a12 b6 to another cell in the same page , you can change it to a 12 b 6 note that both the column and row get a this is handy because it allows you to lock one part of the formula and not the other you can also press f4 to cycle through the lock options if you create your formula in a single sheet , the formula wo n't bother to remember what sheet it is in , so if you copy that formula to another sheet it will use the same reference on the new sheet but if you add your sheet name to your formula then copying that formula will always reference that sheet so a12 b6 will give you a12 b6 of whatever sheet you copy the formula to , but sheet1 a 12 sheet1 b 6 will always refer to a12 b6 of sheet 1 hope this helps ! __eou__	Agent

OQ	i have a document organized in a multi level list some areas of text is in section 4 1 \( heading 2 depth \) other areas of text are in section 5 2 4 \( heading 3 depth \) i would like for figures in section 4 1 to have a chapter number depth of heading 2 \( this gives a figure name of figure 4 1 \) i would like for figures in section 5 2 4 to have a chapter number depth of heading 3 \( this gives a figure name of figure 5 2 4 \) the problem is that the chapter number heading depth is acting as a document wide global setting i ca n't get a 2 heading chapter depth in some figure captions as well as a 3 heading chapter depth in other figure captions in the same document when i add a new caption , the whole document adjusts to the heading depth of the caption just added i am on word 2010 v14 0 7188 5002 __eou__	User
PA	you will have to make use of \( at least \) two caption labels one for figures under level 1 headings and one for figures under the level 2 headings you may not find it worth the effort __eou__	Agent
FD_FQ	so it does n't let me create a duplicate figure caption label i would have to create like a figure2 caption label however it will then insert figure2 as text in my document to fix i can exclude label from caption and manually add figure text in front of the numbering for each caption in the document \( or just delete the 2 from the document , it seems to let me do that \) not quite as automated as i 'd like , but it seems to be a workaround i think this would be a great feature add for new versions of word rather than make me choose which heading level i want , let it auto sense what heading level is just above the figure and use that one thanks __eou__	User
PA	to quickly insert the caption below heading level 2 heading , you can create an autotext \( building block \) entry for it start by inserting an example caption using your label , select the whole thing and save it as an autotext __eou__	Agent
