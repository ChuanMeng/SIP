OQ	my hard drive failed i replaced the hard drive and uploaded the recover disks however , they were for windows 7 i had upgraded to windows 10 during the free upgrade period how can i reupgrade to windows 10 \? thanks __eou__	User
PA	if you installed windows 10 on that system and it was activated successfully just grab the windows 10 iso , make bootable media , boot from it and install windows 10 \( skipping the part where it asks for a key or selecting an option that says you have a digital license or are re installing windows 10 \) and it should activate happily once done __eou__	Agent
PA	step 1 how to download official windows 10 iso files step 2 how to perform a clean install of windows 10 when you upgraded from a previous version of windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with windows 10 , what happened is the hardware \( your pc \) will get a digital entitlement , where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on microsoft activation servers the windows 7 or windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key anytime you need to reinstall windows 10 on that machine , just proceed to reinstall windows 10 it will automatically reactivate you will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation , click i do n't have a key and do this later there is no need to know or get a new key , but if you have issues with digital licensing or the activation troubleshooter , you can utilize an existing windows 7 or windows 8 8 1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary or use the reset function in windows 10 __eou__	Agent

PA	check to see if some animation is there on those slides go to the slide animations animation pane will display if some animation is there __eou__	Agent
PF	your suggestion was helpful because i started to look at my problem from a different perspective , and so it was looking at the animation that i thought about the audio tracks as being animation too williexcept , i discovered it was the voice and music tracks that were not trimmed that caused the slides not to progress to the next slide it was due to a music track being longer than the voice track which ran beyond both by playing on with the longer background music track after i trimmed both to match , there was no problem with slide sequence progression thank you for your guidance was not the correct answer , but you helped me by pointing into the right direction for the ultimate solution to my problem __eou__	User

OQ	a friend runs skype for windows 10 when she shuts down her computer while being signed into skype , i will see her in my skype contacts as 'away' while her computer is off only when she signs off from skype prior to shutting down her computer will her status in my skype be 'offline' \( as i would expect \) is there any way to make skype for windows 10 sign off automatically during shutdown so that she does not have to do that manually \? \( this works correctly in my older skype for windows desktop running on windows 8 1 \) __eou__	User

PA	you are speaking of a reverse image search , something that is being explored by a number of companies due to the processing power and storage involved in such an algorithm , i do n't think a stand alone app is going to be made anytime soon but that does n't preclude an app that taps the processing and storage of outside servers and simply produces the results the returns would be akin to any other 'scraping' app so your success would depend greatly on the relationship you develop with the people providing the actual information __eou__	Agent

OQ	so about a month ago my legacy skype ios version i'm using logged out and never logged back in , ca n't connect to skype being the error message \( posted on here \) the issue , i presume , is due to something server side being taken down , while it is still hardcoded in the config of this legacy version \( 4 17 135 \) interestingly , a 4 18 15 \( 8 1 0 47312 \) skype build \( ipad targeted , i believe , but has iphone assets and works on iphone \) logs in as normal i figured if i could transfer the config from the ipad working version , i can continue using 4 17 135 so far , the main \( or so i thought \) changes i spotted were in \( primary \) server in the per account config xml \( s gateway messenger live com instead of bn2 s gateway messenger live com in 4 17 135 \) , updout and supernode in shared xml however , inserting new values did n't do the trick surprisingly , just copying the credentials3 string from the account specific config xml of 4 18 15 logs you in automatically \( due to the default string in the config i guess \) , but if you log out it 's the same error all over again and the string is removed , so a one time solution anyone have any clues \? __eou__	User
PA	hi paul , welcome to the skype community forum i know how important it is for you to use the 4 17 135 skype version however , we have fully stopped supporting this version and upgraded the app to 4 18 15 and that 's the reason why you 're getting the same error message all over again we always recommend to use the latest version of skype for the best possible experience there are few reasons why you should update your application \( s \) i hope this helps kindly let us know if you have questions regards , rhiza emonica __eou__	Agent

PA_PF	solution to blocking advertisement thanks to ellen barry for posting this to microsoft sudoku page on facebook the solution is to change the size of fonts and icons \( change dpi scaling level \) windows ensures that everything appears on the screen at a usable and consistent size by instructing applications to resize their content by a scale factor most desktop monitors and notebook lcd 's are usually in the range of 95 110 dpi , windows sets a scale factor of 100 by default when you change the dpi scaling level for your monitor , it changes the size of text , apps and other items to appear larger or smaller a higher dpi level has everything appear larger , and a lower dpi level has everything appear smaller start with all apps closed , and right click an empty area on your desktop , and click display settings click on display on the left pane if you have more than one display connected to your computer , then select a monitor in the right pane that you want to change the dpi of under change the size of text , apps and other items , move the slider left or right to the dpi percentage you want to set for that monitor 6 click on apply 7 if the selected dpi is optimal for your usage , click on sign out now for the settings to take effect my surface pro \( 1 \) was set to 150 when i changed back to 100 my screen fonts all went smaller \( sadly \) , but the game now works properly __eou__	Agent

FD_PA	as joy chen suggested , the final update to office 2008 was released before the initial introduction of the operating system on which you 're running it accordingly , drivers for printers other devices have been revised to comply with the requirements of the newer os in a nutshell , it 's quite possible that this is something that ca n't be resolved that being said , one thing you might try in excel , go to file print area clear print area , then see if the entire range is included when you print if that does n't correct the problem select the entire range you want to print , including the row of field names , then go back to file print area set print area to see whether that makes any difference __eou__	Agent

OQ	for years i 've used data connections to retrieve tables from a password protected website since a recent excel update during the summer it does n't work anymore the website seems unchanged to gain access to the data in excel 2016 i had to log in with my user name and password via the internet explorer first with chrome or firefox it never worked after signing in via ie , excel had access for weeks or even months before i had to log in again above does n't work anymore i 've tried it with edge assuming microsoft changed the web browser technology in excel but no luck has someone a solution to regain access again \? thanks ! __eou__	User

PA	hello laura moseley , i believe you re referring to the mute button on the new skype app if you press the mute button , the other user will not hear your voice all you need to do is press the button again to unmute if you re having issues with this , i strongly suggest to you uninstall and reinstall the skype app on your device to get the latest version let me know if this information helps please do not hesitate to reply to this thread if you need further help __eou__	Agent
FD_NF	im not referring to the mute button im referring to the hold button whenever i get a phone call in my cell number , it has always immediately put the skype call on hold then when im finished with tbe cell call , i go back to skype and take the call off hold with the new skype , the cell call comes in as always , call gets placed on hold and when finished there is no way to take that call off hold the only way is to hang up and call back has nothing to do with the mute button ive pushed the mute button in my endeavors to find out how to fix this problem before i came here nothing works and i have uninstalled and reinstalled skype three or four times and nothing my friends are experiencing the same issue , its not just me and ive read this issue being rampant on google as well when researched in the first reply to this question , it was stated that function isnt implemented yet which in my books is asinine you dont release a version of something that allows you to place a call on hold yet dont allow you to take the call off hold completely rediculous __eou__	User

PA	hello tylerfogg , we want to create the best possible app experience for our skype users which means we must make some changes along the way these decisions are hard to make but will enable us to focus our efforts on transitioning skype from a peer to peer video and chat app to a modern , mobile friendly cloud architecture skype on the cloud means you can access all of your chats and shared images on any device with the same skype account and consume less battery power with these , we can no longer get back to the older version of skype for ipad 6 35 1 alternatively , you can uninstall and reinstall skype for ipad to uninstall skype for ipad , simply touch and hold the skype icon on your home screen until the icon begins to shake and an x appears in the corner of the skype icon release the icon and then tap the x this will delete skype from ipad reboot your device reinstall skype from the app store and do another reboot before signing back in to skype hope this helps let me know if you need further assistance thank you ! __eou__	Agent

OQ	when i'm going through a large word document inserting headers , any text that is formatted into multiple columns \( and all the text below it \) does not minimize under the corresponding header text that is n't formatted into multiple columns minimizes just fine , but as soon as i format a chunk of text into multiple columns , those columns and any text below them no longer minimize properly \( until i get to the next header , at which point the issue is reset until i use column formatting agaim \) here is a photo to illustrate my problem i'm running windows 10 and have an office 365 home subscription is this a feature that 's supposed to be there \? or is this an issue i can fix \? i want to be able to minimize text under headers to make working with large documents easier , but this issue breaks that functionality thanks for any help __eou__	User
PA	hi , sometimes , restarting your office apps resolves this kind of issue we suggest that you perform the steps provided on this article to help you with your concern this article contains steps on how to repair an office application let us know if you need additional assistance __eou__	Agent
FD_FQ_NF	i tried your suggestion and it did n't work i also tested this formatting issue on my friends laptop and they 're experiencing the same issue \( column formatted text not minimizing under headers \) do you know of anything else i can try \? __eou__	User
PA	you are n't going to be able to do what you want the reason is that there is a section break between the heading and the multi column text , which is required in order to change the number of columns the collapse mechanism is built to collapse anything from the heading down to but not including the next heading of the same outline level or the next section break if the heading comes after the section break \( that is , it 's part of the multi column section \) , then collapsing the heading will collapse the text below it again , down to the next heading of the same level or the next section break __eou__	Agent
CQ	thank you so much i 've been trying to get a straightforward answer on this issue for a week now , and you 've given it to me i'm guessing there 's no workaround that exists to make it so that the transition from normal text to columns is n't registered as a section break \? __eou__	User
PA	there are a couple of possibilities , but they 'll involve additional fiddling with the text if you need to edit it one way is to replace the two column section \( and the section breaks at its beginning and end \) with a two column one row table and turn off its borders you 'll then have to manually move text \( and any images \) from the end of the first column to the second column to balance the column lengths if you later add or remove anything in the table , you 'll have to manually rebalance the columns another way is to use two side by side text boxes use the size settings on the drawing tools tab to make them the same size to ensure that the text boxes stay where you want them , click drawing tools position more layout options and set the first box to left relative to column and the second box right relative to column , both of them top relative to margin click in the left box and click the create link button on the drawing tools tab , and then click in the right box now text will flow from the left box to the right box \( note that the boxes do n't automatically resize when the text exceeds their total length another manual adjustment they also do n't continue to the next page you 'd have to draw another pair of text boxes and link from box 2 to box 3 and then from box 3 to box 4 there 's a maximum of 32 linked boxes \) __eou__	Agent

OQ	because it seems that the search in bing suddenly changed and it 's creating an entirely new window instead of just adding a tab which i much prefer __eou__	User
PA	searching with bing does not open a new tab or a new window i would presume it is the web browser you are using that would be causing a search to open in a new tab window web browser settings are in various different locations in different browsers , but are normally easy to find you should probably be able to mess with some of the settings and fix your new tab new window issue __eou__	Agent

OQ	i am working for my company to add captions to our powerpoint classes we have srt files for the captions embedded in the videos , which are mp4s we are using powerpoint 2016 when we insert videos that have the captions embedded in them , they will playback on a mac computer with the subtitles showing and there is even a cc button in the player bar this is excellent , and we would like to accomplish the same on windows however , on windows , when we use those same embedded videos , no captions appear and there is no cc control in the player bar to turn them on or off we have used stamp as a workaround , but it is not ideal because turning off captions would require the educator to go through the whole project and turn them off slide by slide prior to the class this is not ideal for our customers , so we would like the most basic and simple functionality , like the mac has how can we get our embedded videos to show the captions without needing to build captions in powerpoint \? thank you __eou__	User
PA	powerpoint 2016 has a new method that uses a simpler format for caption files , called webvtt closed captions are stored in a text based file with a vtt filename extension cc button in powerpoint 2016 does appear when captions are added successfully if you have a video and separate captions , please make sure caption should be saved in vtt extension and the first line must say , simply webvtt , for the detailed steps , see create closed captions for a video once you have saved the caption in the required format , use video tool ribbon to insert the caption , check the following article for details add captions or subtitles in powerpoint thanks , taylor __eou__	Agent

NF	kevin k , i do n't believe that has anything to do with the question being asked as far as i know , this is a universal problem with windows since the beginning and remains in windows 10 windows does not store windows sizes if you change your screen resolution so that the it 's too small for existing windows , they will resize down to fit then , when you restore to the other higher resolution , the windows do n't change they only change if the resolution is too small for them this also occurs in tablet mode when moving between landscape and portrait , because the previously long dimension becomes only the width of the new short dimension for example , if you have a 2520x1440 screen in landscape , and have a window that 's about 2 , 000 pixels across , then rotate to portrait mode , it will be resized down to 1440 or less pixels \( often less because it may keep the upper left point at the same place , meaning the remaining width to the edge of the screen is even shorter \) this is fine and reasonable for changing resolutions the problem is that the windows do n't restore when reverting to the prior resolution i have never seen it work they way we would expect on any system \( have not checked a surface pro , maybe it 's finally fixed there \) definitely not a function of having the latest drivers , at least not in most cases __eou__	Agent
FD	i think the way the original problem was described is n't addressed by a driver issue basically , if i have a window open \( custom sized , not maximized \) , and i switch between portrait and landscape mode the screen will shrink to fit the portrait view , but will not return to the original size when rotated back to landscape view especially more annoying , is that the window does n't need to be visible any open applications \( minimized \) also get resized to fit portrait , but not resized to the original size when rotating back to landscape view i suspect this would be a feature request \( because i ca n't find any setting that would yield this behavior and it means it 'll likely never be implemented \) it 's extremely annoying , particularly because i often have a dozen or so apps open , and when i rotate , all of them are resized __eou__	Agent

PA	hi kennethgames ! thanks for posting here we 're working to fix this ! there 's a multitude of ways contacts could have gotten into your contact list and many of those ways do not involve you manually adding them for example , if you have an outlook com account tied to your skype account , your outlook contacts might be shown in your contact list or if you synced your address book in the past and contacts got imported that way the contact might have changed their display name to something unrecognizable we understand our users often do n't like seeing these contacts in their contact list and want control over who shows up , so we 're making sure some of these contacts are n't added automatically moving forward stay tuned ! __eou__	Agent
IR_PA	hi brittany0 , first of all , sorry to hear that you feel that way \( we care ! could you please elaborate on contacts form our own contacts \? do you mean the fact that we are recommending contacts based on mutual friends \? if you feel this is a privacy issue for you , you have the option to hide yourself from these recommendations you can go to your profile and there should be an option under privacy for appear in search results and suggestions if you switch that off , your skype account will not be recommended to others nor will your account be used in counting of mutual friends in other people 's results __eou__	Agent

PA	hi christophertop , based on your description , you want to update the word macro enabled template in word 2016 for macchristopher regarding but cannot save with that name , because it already exists please note that we cannot put two documents with same name in the same location , this is why you cannot save the new document you can try the steps below 1 go to users library group containers ubf8t346g9 office user content templates on macchristopher , find the template normal dotm 2 move the document from the location and back up it in another place on the macchristopher 3 create a new word document set 300 for the zoom and keep the document blank go to file save as template type the name normal for document name and choose the file format word macchristopherro enabled template \( dotm \) save the new template on desktop 4 move the new template in the original location users library group containers ubf8t346g9 office user content templates regards , tinachristopher __eou__	Agent
FD_FQ	thanks i have done that and the default zoom is now 300 as wanted , but there is a problem i have also many macros inside tools christopherro macchristopherros , and most of them have gone doing that how to do it and keep all such macros \? in other words , how to update normal dotm , keeping all previous content and settings , but just changing zoom from 200 to 300 for my brand new imacchristopher 5k 27 inch \? i do not understand why word does not allow to overwrite previous normal dotm , which would accomplish that thanks __eou__	User
PA	first of all , the instructions from christopher chen will cause trouble sooner or later a user document saved with the name normal dotm will not function properly as a basis for new documents the normal dotm must be generated by the program it would have been better to open the original normal dotm change the zoom level there unfortunately , this has been made difficult due to apple 's decision to make the library folders for user accounts hidden by default os x 10 7 later as a result it cannot be accessed from within the program unless you first unhide that folder hopefully you have not deleted your former normal dotm template or did follow the suggestion to create a backup of it if that 's the case i 'd suggest that you to retrieve your macchristopherros as well as any user defined styles , autotext items if you have n't deleted your former normal dotm template , use the organizer to copy the customizations from one template or document to another the organizer can be reached from either of several directions the newly generated normal dotm will be displayed in one column close the document1 in the other column navigate to open the former normal dotm containing your macros see the word article make a macro available to all documents in word 2016 for macchristopher word if you have deleted your former normal dotm based on the instructions from tinachristopher chen without creating a backup well , all i can say is that her reply is evidence of the adage a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing you still may be able to use organizer to copy macros from other documents into the new normal dotm template __eou__	Agent
PA	this reply is not only incorrect , it is irresponsible to the point of potentially causing serious inconvenience other problems for the user for at least 2 reasons replacing normal dotm is a corrective measure to be used only if there is an issue which suggests that it is corrupt or damaged doing so is n't something to be done just to effect a simple change in parameters further , when it is justified it must be done properly __eou__	Agent
FD	hi kelli , thanks for your correction and suggestions next time i will pay more attention to this macchristophertop , please refer to bobkelli 's suggestions to open the original normal dotm file and change the zoom level regards , tinachristopher __eou__	Agent

OQ	hi , i have just noticed that my phone automatically updated my mobil skype app i have everything about it and wish i can revert the new version is completely useless to me in its current form the problem i have with it is that people who i have been connected with for 15 years ca n't reach me on my mobil iphone their calls are now only being received by mac book pro lap top although the previous updates at least kept the app operational , although worse with each update , nothings do n't work at all everything has been wiped out without my consent , besides my id , login and password even my profile picture but the worse is that i can find access to my contact list i had there for the last 15 years , they are not the same contacts that are in my us phone book , they are all overseas and their information was only available on skype in all previous versions it remained intact and intuitive how horrible is the app design if you have to do a research on how to access your own data on the account if it is even there synching my phone contacts does n't do any good in my situation , my notebook still has the old version , which may help in some data recovery , but how am i supposed to reenter it into a new app \? how am i supposed to connect to people who were always in my skype connected with me , but were never entered in my phone because there was never a need for it phone list was for phone call people , and skype was to call people overseas who do n't have access to international phone lines , or wi fi strictly mobil apps like whatsapp and viber or older generation who can handle a desktop version but does n't have access to mobil the whole point of having skype mobil was to not have to lag a laptop around and have skype in my phone to talk to my parents and grandparents overseas being available to them 24 7 with the new upgrade i do n't even see how this can still work and continue to be useful if there is no remedy and reinstalling my old contact list , there is no point for me to keep or use this mobil app version of skype __eou__	User

FD_PA	the issue is n't random \) it is that the built in list styles in word include a 5 left indent for the list item text if the number of items goes beyond single digits that indent often is not enough which causes the indentation to go to the next available tab stop especially when larger font sizes are applied by default , that tap stop is at 1' which is what causes the gap there are several ways to adjust it one option is to simply use a smaller font size , but based on how you 've constructed the list it seems the better way may be to another option would be to do as above , but as step 5 just change the number position to right \( or centered \) rather than left __eou__	Agent

FD_OQ	when i hit the space bar repeatedly , dots appear how do i stop this feature \? \? __eou__	User
FD_PA	the dots you 're referring to are nonprinting characters which represent use of the space bar they do not print are visible only when display of nonprinting characters is toggled on to toggle them off , use the button in the paragraph group on the home tab or use the keyboard shortcut command 8 just an additional note i'm not sure why you 're 'hitting the space bar repeatedly' but depending on the purpose there are better ways to gain horizontal separation , such as using tab stops or tables keep in mind that a space is not a defined measurement unit the width of a space varies dependent on a number of variables which creates alignment problems other undesirable effects on text flow __eou__	Agent
FD_PA	adding to patricia 's correct remarks 4 use tables and tabs to arrange text in microsoft word __eou__	Agent
